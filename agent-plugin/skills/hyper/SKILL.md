description: Use when working in or setting up a project space — a bare git repo with worktrees/ and local-only directories. Covers where files belong, why the space root is never committed, and how worktrees are created. Triggers on "space", "worktree layout", "where should this file go", "bare repo", "wt switch".

# Project Spaces

A space gives a project a fixed shape: every worktree in one place, plus
directories for files that must never be committed.

A space has exactly one layout. Space files and project files never share a
directory — the project lives in `worktrees/<branch>`, the space's local-only
directories live beside it.

## The layout

```
<space>/
├── .git/         bare repo — shared object store, no working tree
├── .claude/      settings scoped to this project (wire the space memory)
├── .hyper/    plugin metadata; space memory in .hyper/memory/
├── worktrees/    one worktree per branch, created by `wt switch`
│   ├── main/
│   └── fix-thing/
├── data/  notes/  scratch/  bin/
└── HYPER.md
```

The root is not a working tree. Nothing there can be committed — not by
accident, not by a stray `git add -A`. Local-only files get a home structurally
incapable of reaching the remote. There is no `.gitignore` to maintain and no
protection to erode: the safety is structural, which is the point.

An ordinary checkout is not a space and cannot be decorated into one.
`/hyper:adopt` **converts** it: the repo becomes bare and the whole working
tree moves to `worktrees/<branch>` — dirty state, untracked files,
`node_modules`, everything. Existing linked worktrees are moved in with
`git worktree move`. The conversion prints its full plan as a dry run, refuses
unsafe states (detached HEAD, rebase/merge/cherry-pick in progress,
submodules), verifies `git status` before and after, and never deletes
anything.

## Am I in one

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/hyper-stack.sh" detect   # toolchain
```

For the layout, `hyper-lib.sh` exposes `space_layout <dir>` (prints
`bare` or nothing) and `worktrees_dir <dir>`. Rules of thumb:

- `.git` is a **directory** with `core.bare=true`, with a `worktrees/` dir or
  `HYPER.md` beside it → a space. A bare repo with *neither* is a plain
  mirror or hosting remote, not a space — `space_layout` prints nothing for it.
- `.git` is a **directory**, not bare → an ordinary checkout; not a space
  until `/hyper:adopt` converts it.
- `.git` is a **file** → you are in a linked worktree, not a space root.

A plain bare repository is *not* treated as a space until it opts in by having
`HYPER.md` or a top-level `worktrees/`. Without that gate every mirror on
the machine would claim to be one.

## The corollary

**Nothing at the space root is backed up.** A dump in `data/` exists on
exactly one disk.

## Where a file goes

| The file is… | Put it in |
|---|---|
| a DB dump, CSV fixture, tarball, sample dataset | `data/` |
| a review brief, handoff doc, design note, scratch writing | `notes/` |
| output you will not miss tomorrow | `scratch/` |
| a script you run against this project | `bin/` |
| part of the codebase | a worktree — it gets committed |

When unsure between `notes/` and `scratch/`: if losing it would cost you more
than ten minutes, it is not scratch.

## Rules

- **Never commit from the space root.** The bare repo has no index in the
  usual sense; `cd` into a worktree first.
- **Create worktrees with `wt switch <branch>`**, not `git worktree add`. The
  user's worktrunk config controls placement and strips branch prefixes, so
  `fix/foo` becomes `worktrees/foo`. Doing it by hand puts the tree in the
  wrong place and skips post-start hooks (dependency install, hooksPath fix).
- **`scratch/` is disposable.** Anything there may be deleted without warning.
- Worktrees have their own `.claude/` and `CLAUDE.md`; those *are* committed.
  Space-level `.claude/` is local and shared across all worktrees. Space
  memory lives in `.hyper/memory/`, wired via `autoMemoryDirectory` in the
  space's `.claude/settings.json` and each worktree's
  `.claude/settings.local.json` (the value must be absolute — moving the
  space means re-running `/hyper:adopt --apply`).

## Which command, in what order

There is no single "set this project up" command. For an existing project:

1. `/hyper:adopt <path>` — dry run first, read the output. On an ordinary
   checkout this prints a **conversion plan** (every root entry and where it
   moves); on a bare repo it lists what would be scaffolded.
2. For a conversion, walk the user through the plan and get explicit
   confirmation. For a bare space, act on the loose-file suggestions **one at
   a time**, confirming each — they are heuristics; several categories are
   explicitly "leave in place".
3. `/hyper:adopt <path> --apply` — convert, or create the scaffold.
4. `/hyper:tools <path>` — detect the toolchain and wire the check hook.
5. `/hyper:audit <path>` — the judgement checks, any time after.

`/hyper:init` is only for creating a *new* space from a remote. It does
not apply to a project that already exists on disk.

Nothing in the plugin deletes anything, with one controlled exception:
`/hyper:cleanup` deletes what audit classifies as debris — orphaned
worktrees, parked leftovers, gone branches, scratch contents — one explicitly
confirmed id at a time, re-verified at deletion time.

## Commands

- `/hyper:help` — orientation: what the plugin is, all commands, the
  standard flow. Point new users here first.
- `/hyper:init <repo-url> [name]` — create a new space
- `/hyper:adopt [path] [--apply]` — scaffold a bare repo into a space, or
  convert an ordinary checkout into one
- `/hyper:audit [path]` — report drift, read-only. The mechanical checks
  are scripted (`hyper-audit.sh`); judging each finding is not.
- `/hyper:cleanup [path]` — the audit-findings executor and the one
  command that deletes: lists candidates with stable ids, deletes only ids
  named explicitly, each confirmed per item and re-verified before `rm`.
- `/hyper:tools [path]` — detect the project toolchain and wire the
  check hook. See the `hyper-tooling` skill; the commands are
  project-specific and must be detected or asked about, never assumed. The
  same config file gates the deps friction hook, which asks for one sentence
  of justification when an edit adds a new dependency.
- `/hyper:plan <feature> [phase]` — the four-phase spec workflow: Define,
  Design, Decompose, Develop. Artifacts live under `notes/specs/`.
- `/hyper:gen [template] [dest]` — generate files from a project template;
  deterministic copy, agent authoring only inside marked prompt regions.

## Detecting a space

See "Am I in one" above for the layout rules. `HYPER.md` is the
explicit marker, but a space is also recognised from structure alone —
a bare `.git` with a top-level `worktrees/` beside it — so spaces predating
this plugin still work without the marker.

To find the root from anywhere inside, walk up until that shape appears. A
linked worktree has a `.git` *file*, so it is skipped and the walk continues to
the real root. When `cwd` is the root itself, take extra care — that is where
commits and loose files go wrong.

## Worktrunk interaction

Placement comes from the user-level worktrunk config, roughly:

```toml
worktree-path = "{{ repo_path }}/../worktrees/{{ branch | replace('fix/', '') | ... | sanitize }}"
```

`repo_path` is the worktree `wt` runs from, so `../worktrees/` resolves to the
space's `worktrees/`. Because this is user-level, it applies to every
project — a space must use that directory name for `wt` to work correctly.

Worktrees of a bare repo get a `.git` *file* rather than a directory, which
breaks relative `core.hooksPath`. The worktrunk `post-start` hook fixes it with
`git config core.hooksPath "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/hooks"`.
