# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our FAQ](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/FAQ.md)

The important folders in this project are:

- `.changeset` - Source of truth for versioning and publishing
- `packages/` - The packages that will be versioned and published

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
bunx changeset
```

This will prompt you to select the packages that have changed and describe the changes.

## Releasing

When changesets are merged to main, the release workflow will:

1. Create a release PR with version bumps
2. When the release PR is merged, publish to npm

Packages are published in dependency order:
- @hypercli/core
- @hypercli/kit
- @hypercli/gen
- @hypercli/cli
