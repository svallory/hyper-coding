# Hyper Coding in Practice: Development Challenges and Concrete Solutions

## Introduction

This document maps specific software development challenges to concrete, implementable solutions within the Hyper Coding methodology. Each solution is practical and can be implemented with existing tools or straightforward custom development.

## AI Code Generation Challenges

### Context and Scope Management

**Challenge:** Model hallucinations lead to implementation of out-of-scope features
**Solution:** Introduce a `/epic:mission` command before the `/epic:plan` phase to define abstract mission and goals. Add reflection points where the model checks if implementation moves toward the mission. Store mission in CLAUDE.md for persistent context.

**Challenge:** AI loses track of project objectives during long sessions
**Solution:** Implement session hooks that reload project objectives every 10 interactions. Display current objective in terminal prompt. Add `/epic:check-alignment` command for manual verification.

**Challenge:** Scope creep during implementation
**Solution:** Generate a `scope-boundaries.md` file during planning that explicitly lists what's NOT in scope. Reference this file in PreToolUse hooks to validate all changes against boundaries.

### Code Duplication and Reuse

**Challenge:** AI creates new implementations of existing code because code wasn't in context
**Solution:** Every time the model creates a new file, use Language Server Protocol to list all symbols. Run similarity search on symbol names and signatures. If similarity > 70%, prompt: "Found similar symbol X. Is this the same purpose?" Cache negative answers to avoid future comparisons.

**Challenge:** Duplicate utility functions across codebase
**Solution:** Create a `utilities-index.json` that catalogs all utility functions with descriptions. Update via PostToolUse hook. Check this index before generating new utilities.

**Challenge:** Repeated patterns with slight variations
**Solution:** Implement pattern detection using AST analysis. When similar patterns detected, generate a template and refactor existing code to use it.

## Code Quality Challenges

### Readability and Naming

**Challenge:** Unclear code with poor naming conventions
**Solution:** Implement a two-pass system: First, generate code. Second, run a "readability review" agent that suggests better names based on function behavior and common conventions. Use a curated dictionary of good/bad naming examples.

**Challenge:** Inconsistent naming across modules
**Solution:** Generate a `naming-conventions.json` from existing code that captures current patterns (camelCase vs snake_case, abbreviations used). Validate all new names against this file.

**Challenge:** Missing or unclear comments
**Solution:** Use AST to identify complex functions (cyclomatic complexity > 5). Automatically prompt AI to add explanatory comments for these specific functions only.

### Code Organization

**Challenge:** Files in wrong directories
**Solution:** Use ts-arch or similar to define allowed file locations based on naming patterns. Run validation in pre-commit hook. Example: `*Controller.ts` must be in `/controllers`.

**Challenge:** Mixed concerns in single files
**Solution:** Analyze file imports and exports. If a file imports from 3+ different layers (e.g., database, API, UI), flag for splitting. Generate refactoring suggestions.

**Challenge:** Inconsistent module structure
**Solution:** Create module template with standard folders (components, services, types, tests). Validate new modules against template structure.

## Architecture Challenges

### Pattern Consistency

**Challenge:** Mixed architectural patterns (some MVC, some functional, some random)
**Solution:** Document chosen patterns in `architecture-decisions.md`. Create file templates for each pattern. In PreToolUse hook, detect file type and enforce appropriate template.

**Challenge:** Layer violations (UI calling database directly)
**Solution:** Define dependency rules in `.archrc`: `ui -> services -> database`. Use dependency-cruiser to enforce. Block commits that violate rules.

**Challenge:** Inconsistent error handling strategies
**Solution:** Create error handling templates for different layers. Detect try-catch blocks and validate they follow templates. Generate middleware for consistent API error responses.

### Domain Modeling (DDD)

**Challenge:** Anemic domain models with logic scattered in services
**Solution:** Scan for classes with only getters/setters. Flag these as anemic. Prompt AI to identify related business logic in services and suggest moving to domain model.

**Challenge:** Unclear bounded contexts
**Solution:** Analyze import/export patterns between modules. Modules with high coupling likely belong in same context. Generate visualization and suggest boundary adjustments.

**Challenge:** Missing domain events
**Solution:** Scan for state changes in domain models. For each state change without corresponding event, prompt: "Should this state change emit a domain event?"

## Security Challenges

### Input Validation

**Challenge:** Missing or inconsistent input validation
**Solution:** Generate JSON Schema for all API endpoints from TypeScript types. Use AJV to automatically validate all inputs against schemas. No manual validation code needed.

**Challenge:** SQL injection vulnerabilities
**Solution:** Ban string concatenation in database files via ESLint rule. Enforce use of parameterized queries. If concatenation detected, fail build immediately.

**Challenge:** XSS vulnerabilities in templates
**Solution:** Configure template engine to auto-escape by default. Create whitelist of allowed HTML tags. Use Content Security Policy headers.

### Authentication and Authorization

**Challenge:** Inconsistent auth implementation across endpoints
**Solution:** Generate auth decorators/middleware from OpenAPI spec. Example: `@RequireAuth`, `@RequireRole('admin')`. Impossible to forget auth when it's declarative.

**Challenge:** Session management vulnerabilities
**Solution:** Use battle-tested session library (express-session). Configure once in initialization. Ban custom session handling via linting rules.

**Challenge:** Hardcoded secrets in code
**Solution:** Pre-commit hook with truffleHog. If secrets detected, block commit and display: "Found secret in file X line Y. Move to .env file."

### Dependency Security

**Challenge:** Vulnerable dependencies
**Solution:** Run `npm audit` in pre-commit hook. If high/critical vulnerabilities found, block commit with message: "Fix with: npm audit fix". For production, use Snyk with PR automation.

**Challenge:** License violations
**Solution:** Use license-checker in CI. Define allowed licenses in `package.json`. If violation found, fail build with: "Package X has incompatible license Y."

## Testing Challenges

### Test Coverage

**Challenge:** Low test coverage for new code
**Solution:** In PostToolUse hook, check coverage for modified files. If < 80%, automatically generate test templates with common cases and prompt for completion.

**Challenge:** Missing edge case tests
**Solution:** Analyze function parameters and identify boundary values (null, undefined, empty array, max integer). Generate test cases for each boundary automatically.

**Challenge:** Poor test quality (tests without assertions)
**Solution:** Parse test files with AST. Flag tests with no `expect()` or `assert()` calls. Fail CI if assertion-less tests found.

### Test Maintenance

**Challenge:** Flaky tests that randomly fail
**Solution:** Track test results over 10 runs. If test fails > 20% of runs, quarantine it automatically. Generate report of quarantined tests for fixing.

**Challenge:** Slow test suites
**Solution:** Time each test. Tests > 1 second get moved to separate "slow" suite that runs less frequently. Generate suggestions for mocking slow dependencies.

**Challenge:** Outdated test data
**Solution:** Generate test data from production schemas. When schema changes, regenerate test data automatically. Use factories instead of fixtures.

## Performance Challenges

### Frontend Performance

**Challenge:** Large bundle sizes
**Solution:** Set bundle budget in webpack config (e.g., 500KB). Build fails if exceeded. Run bundle analyzer and highlight largest dependencies with alternatives.

**Challenge:** Memory leaks in React components
**Solution:** Add eslint-plugin-react-hooks. Enforce cleanup in useEffect. In development, log warning if component unmounts without cleanup.

**Challenge:** Poor Core Web Vitals scores
**Solution:** Add Lighthouse CI to pipeline. Set thresholds: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1. Fail deployment if thresholds not met.

### Backend Performance

**Challenge:** N+1 database queries
**Solution:** Add query logging in development. If same query pattern appears > 5 times in single request, log warning: "Possible N+1 query detected. Consider using JOIN or batch loading."

**Challenge:** Slow API endpoints
**Solution:** Add middleware that logs response time. If > 200ms, automatically profile endpoint and generate optimization suggestions (add index, cache result, paginate).

**Challenge:** Memory leaks in Node.js
**Solution:** Monitor heap usage in production. If memory grows continuously for 1 hour, trigger heap snapshot. Alert with specific leak location.

## Process and Workflow Challenges

### Version Control

**Challenge:** Poor commit messages
**Solution:** Use commitizen with conventional commits. Interactive prompt ensures correct format. Hook validates format and blocks non-compliant commits.

**Challenge:** Large, unfocused commits
**Solution:** Pre-commit hook that counts changed files. If > 20 files, warning: "Large commit detected. Consider splitting into smaller, focused commits."

**Challenge:** Direct commits to main branch
**Solution:** GitHub branch protection rules. Require PR with approval. No exceptions, even for admins.

### Code Review

**Challenge:** PRs too large to review effectively
**Solution:** GitHub Action that checks PR size. If > 400 lines, add label "too-large" and comment: "Consider splitting this PR for easier review."

**Challenge:** Missing context in PRs
**Solution:** PR template with required sections: Problem, Solution, Testing, Screenshots. GitHub marks PR as draft if template not filled.

**Challenge:** Review bottlenecks
**Solution:** Implement "review budget" - each developer must review 2 PRs for every PR they create. Track in dashboard.

### Documentation

**Challenge:** Outdated API documentation
**Solution:** Generate OpenAPI spec from code annotations. Documentation always matches implementation. Host with Swagger UI for testing.

**Challenge:** Missing setup instructions
**Solution:** Generate README.md from package.json scripts. Each script gets documentation from comments. Include "Quick Start" section automatically.

**Challenge:** No architecture documentation
**Solution:** Generate architecture diagrams from code structure using dependency-cruiser. Update automatically on each commit.

## Deployment and Operations Challenges

### Environment Management

**Challenge:** Environment configuration drift
**Solution:** Single source of truth in `.env.example`. CI validates all env vars present. Application fails to start if required vars missing.

**Challenge:** Secrets in wrong places
**Solution:** Use dotenvx or Infisical. Secrets never in repository. CI/CD pulls secrets at deploy time. Local development uses `.env.local`.

**Challenge:** Inconsistent environments
**Solution:** Docker containers for all environments. Same image promoted from dev → staging → production. Only env vars change.

### Monitoring and Debugging

**Challenge:** Silent failures in production
**Solution:** Structured logging with correlation IDs. Every request gets unique ID. All logs for request retrievable with single query.

**Challenge:** No visibility into performance issues
**Solution:** OpenTelemetry automatic instrumentation. Zero code changes needed. Traces show exactly where time is spent.

**Challenge:** Alert fatigue from too many notifications
**Solution:** Alert only on user-facing errors. Internal errors go to error tracking (Sentry). Define SLOs and alert only when violated.

## Team Collaboration Challenges

### Knowledge Sharing

**Challenge:** Knowledge silos where only one person knows system
**Solution:** Rotate code ownership monthly. Each module must have primary and secondary owner. Track in CODEOWNERS file.

**Challenge:** Onboarding new developers takes weeks
**Solution:** Generate interactive onboarding from code structure. New developer runs `npm run onboard` and gets guided tour with tasks.

**Challenge:** Decisions not documented
**Solution:** Template for Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). Major decisions require ADR before implementation. Store in `/docs/decisions`.

### Development Velocity

**Challenge:** Slow project setup
**Solution:** Single command setup: `npx create-hyper-app`. Includes all tools, configurations, and example code. Running in 5 minutes.

**Challenge:** Repetitive boilerplate code
**Solution:** CLI generators for common patterns: `hyper gen component`, `hyper gen api-endpoint`. Templates ensure consistency.

**Challenge:** Waiting for dependencies
**Solution:** Generate mock services from OpenAPI specs. Frontend can develop against mocks while backend implements.

## AI-Specific Challenges

### Hallucination Prevention

**Challenge:** AI references non-existent packages or APIs
**Solution:** Maintain `verified-apis.json` with all valid APIs in project. In PostToolUse hook, validate all function calls against this list. Flag unknowns immediately.

**Challenge:** AI invents plausible but wrong function names
**Solution:** Use TypeScript Language Service API to validate all function calls resolve. If not, prompt: "Function X not found. Did you mean Y?"

**Challenge:** Outdated patterns from training data
**Solution:** Maintain `deprecated-patterns.md` with patterns to avoid. Check generated code against patterns and warn: "Pattern X is deprecated. Use Y instead."

### Context Management

**Challenge:** AI forgets project conventions after long session
**Solution:** Every 20 messages, inject reminder of key conventions from CLAUDE.md. Use session hooks to maintain context.

**Challenge:** Inconsistent code style across sessions
**Solution:** Run formatter immediately after generation. Style becomes irrelevant - tools handle it automatically.

**Challenge:** Lost context between development sessions
**Solution:** Generate session summary at end: what was built, decisions made, next steps. Load summary at start of next session.
