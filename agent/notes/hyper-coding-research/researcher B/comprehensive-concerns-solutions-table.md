## Notes on Hook Selection

- **PostToolUse**: Fastest feedback for code generation issues
- **PreToolUse**: Prevents issues before they enter code
- **Pre-commit**: Catches issues before they enter version control
- **Pre-push**: Validates before sharing with team
- **Runtime**: Catches issues only in execution
- **CI/CD**: Catches issues in pipeline
- **Manual review**: No reliable automation exists

## Automation Level Definitions

- **Fully automated**: Tool handles everything without human intervention
- **Semi-automated**: Tool assists but requires human decision
- **Manual**: No reliable tool exists, requires human expertise
