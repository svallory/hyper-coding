# Comprehensive Code and Product Quality Checklist

This document outlines the quality checkpoints that should be automated in the Hyper Coding methodology to ensure AI-generated code meets professional standards.

## Code Quality Checkpoints

### Static Analysis
- **Linting**: ESLint, Biome, or similar for code style and potential errors
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- **Code Formatting**: Prettier, Biome formatter for consistent style
- **Security Scanning**: Snyk, npm audit for vulnerability detection
- **Dependency Analysis**: Check for outdated packages, license compliance

### Code Structure and Architecture
- **Architecture Compliance**: Verify adherence to project patterns (MVC, Clean Architecture, etc.)
- **Import Organization**: Consistent import ordering and grouping
- **File Organization**: Proper file/folder structure according to conventions
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent variable, function, class naming
- **Code Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity analysis
- **Dead Code Detection**: Identify unused imports, variables, functions

### Testing Quality
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum threshold (e.g., 80% line coverage)
- **Test Quality**: Meaningful assertions, proper mocking
- **Test Types**: Unit, integration, e2e test presence
- **Test Naming**: Descriptive test names and descriptions
- **Test Organization**: Proper test file structure and grouping

### Documentation Quality
- **Code Comments**: Meaningful comments for complex logic
- **API Documentation**: JSDoc/TSDoc for public interfaces
- **README Updates**: Keep documentation current with changes
- **Type Definitions**: Proper TypeScript declarations
- **Examples**: Working code examples in documentation

### Performance and Optimization
- **Bundle Size**: Check for excessive bundle growth
- **Performance Metrics**: Core Web Vitals compliance
- **Memory Usage**: Check for memory leaks
- **Database Queries**: N+1 query detection
- **Caching Strategy**: Appropriate caching implementation

## Product Quality Checkpoints

### User Experience
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance, screen reader compatibility
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first design compliance
- **Cross-browser**: Support for target browsers
- **Loading Performance**: Fast initial page loads
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states and user feedback

### Functional Requirements
- **Feature Completeness**: All specified features implemented
- **Business Logic**: Correct implementation of business rules
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
- **Edge Cases**: Proper handling of boundary conditions
- **Integration Points**: Correct API integrations

### Deployment and Operations
- **Environment Configuration**: Proper environment variable handling
- **Health Checks**: Monitoring and alerting setup
- **Logging**: Appropriate log levels and structured logging
- **Error Tracking**: Error reporting and monitoring
- **Rollback Strategy**: Ability to revert problematic deployments
