# Claude Code Features for Generation Steering and Control

This document outlines Claude Code's capabilities for controlling and steering AI code generation, crucial for implementing the Hyper Coding methodology.

## Core Control Mechanisms

### 1. Memory System (CLAUDE.md)
**Purpose**: Maintain consistent context and behavior across sessions

**Hierarchy**: Enterprise → Team → User → Project
- **Enterprise Policy**: System-wide standards and constraints
- **Project Memory (team)**: Shared team conventions and patterns  
- **User Memory**: Personal coding preferences and shortcuts
- **Project Memory (local)**: Project-specific context and rules

**Key Features**:
- Automatic loading on Claude Code startup
- Hierarchical precedence (higher levels override lower)
- File imports via `@path/to/import` syntax
- Recursive memory loading (up to 5 levels)
- Quick addition with `#` shortcut
- Edit with `/memory` command

**Use Cases for Hyper Coding**:
- Define coding standards and architectural patterns
- Specify quality checkpoints and validation rules
- Document project-specific context and constraints
- Maintain consistency across development sessions

### 2. Slash Commands
**Purpose**: Interactive workflow control and task execution

**Built-in Commands**:
- `/review`: Request structured code review
- `/init`: Initialize project with guided setup
- `/agents`: Manage specialized AI subagents
- `/config`: View/modify configuration settings
- `/cost`: Monitor token usage and costs
- `/model`: Switch between AI models
- `/clear`: Clear conversation history
- `/help`: Access documentation and guidance

**Custom Commands**:
- Created in `.claude/commands/` directory
- Support argument passing and file references
- Can execute bash commands and scripts
- Support project-specific and personal namespaces

**Use Cases for Hyper Coding**:
- Trigger quality validation workflows
- Execute project-specific build and test commands
- Switch between different AI models for different tasks
- Access project-specific tooling and scripts

### 3. Hooks System
**Purpose**: Automated quality control and workflow customization

**Hook Types**:

**PreToolUse Hooks**:
- Execute before any tool is used
- Can validate or modify tool parameters
- Can block potentially risky operations
- Example: Validate shell commands before execution

**PostToolUse Hooks**:
- Execute after tool completion
- Can perform additional checks or actions
- Can trigger follow-up workflows
- Example: Run linting after file modifications

**UserPromptSubmit Hooks**:
- Triggered when user submits a prompt
- Can inject additional context
- Can filter or modify requests
- Example: Add project context to every request

**SessionStart/SessionEnd Hooks**:
- Manage session initialization and cleanup
- Load project context or log statistics
- Example: Load recent changes on session start

**Configuration Example**:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Write|Edit",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "/usr/local/bin/validate-code-quality.sh"
      }]
    }],
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Write",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command", 
        "command": "moon run :lint --fix"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### 4. Sub-Agents System
**Purpose**: Specialized AI agents for specific tasks

**Available Agent Types**:
- **Code Reviewer**: Focused on code quality and patterns
- **Test Writer**: Specialized in test generation
- **Documentation Writer**: API and project documentation
- **Refactoring Specialist**: Code improvement and optimization
- **Security Auditor**: Security-focused code analysis

**Management**:
- Access via `/agents` command
- Can be configured with specific contexts
- Support specialized prompting and behavior
- Can be chained for complex workflows

### 5. Output Styles and Formatting
**Purpose**: Control how AI generates and presents code

**Features**:
- Customizable output formatting
- Code style enforcement
- Template-based generation
- Consistent formatting across sessions

## Advanced Control Features

### 6. GitHub Actions Integration
**Purpose**: Automated workflows and CI/CD integration

**Capabilities**:
- Trigger Claude Code from GitHub workflows
- Automated code review and suggestions
- Integration with existing CI/CD pipelines
- Batch processing for multiple files/projects

### 7. Configuration Management
**Purpose**: Project and user-specific settings

**Configuration Levels**:
- User-level settings (`~/.config/claude-code/`)
- Project-level settings (`.claude/`)
- Environment-specific overrides

**Configurable Elements**:
- Default models and behavior
- Hook configurations
- Custom command definitions
- Memory file locations
- Output formatting preferences

### 8. Context Awareness
**Purpose**: Maintain project understanding across interactions

**Features**:
- Working directory discovery
- Git repository awareness
- File relationship understanding
- Project structure comprehension
- Dependency graph awareness

## Implementation Strategies for Hyper Coding

### Quality Gates Implementation
1. **Pre-Generation Validation**:
   - Use PreToolUse hooks to validate requests
   - Check against project standards in CLAUDE.md
   - Verify architectural compliance

2. **Post-Generation Quality Control**:
   - PostToolUse hooks for immediate quality checks
   - Automated linting and formatting
   - Type checking and static analysis

3. **Continuous Context Management**:
   - CLAUDE.md files maintain project context
   - Memory hierarchy ensures consistency
   - Session hooks manage state transitions

### Workflow Orchestration
1. **Custom Commands for Common Tasks**:
   - Build and test validation commands
   - Quality assurance workflows
   - Deployment preparation scripts

2. **Agent Specialization**:
   - Use specific agents for different quality aspects
   - Chain agents for comprehensive validation
   - Maintain agent-specific contexts

3. **Automated Feedback Loops**:
   - Hooks provide immediate feedback
   - Failed quality gates trigger corrective actions
   - Continuous improvement through session logging

## Integration Points for HyperDev

### Template Integration
- CLAUDE.md templates for different project types
- Hook configurations for specific technology stacks
- Custom commands for template-specific workflows

### Quality Assurance
- Automated quality validation through hooks
- Sub-agent specialization for different quality aspects
