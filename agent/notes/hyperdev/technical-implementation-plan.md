# HyperDev Technical Implementation Plan

This document contains detailed technical specifications and implementation plans extracted from the original mission document.

## Required Tools and MCPs

After initializing the project with the selected stack, we need to ensure that all the tools that enable Hyper Coding are installed and ready to use:

### Core MCPs for Hyper Coding
- **Task Master** - https://taskmaster.dev - Project task management and epic orchestration
- **Claude Context MCP** - Semantic codebase search and indexing (replaces generic "Codebase MCP")  
- **Context7 MCP** - https://context7.com/ - Latest library documentation access
- **Playwright MCP** - `npm:@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server` - Browser automation, console checking, screenshots
- **Moon MCP** - Monorepo task and project information (when applicable)
- **Infisical MCP** - Secure secrets management without AI exposure
- **Figma MCP** - `npm:mcp-figma` - Design system access (project-dependent)

## MVP Tool Stack Selection

Based on the research analysis, for the MVP we'll implement a specific JS/TS-focused stack:

### Static Analysis Suite (Essential Foundation)
- **ESLint + Prettier** - Primary choice: Mature ecosystem with extensive security/complexity rules
- **TypeScript** - Strict mode type checking with compiler API integration
- **Alternative**: **Biome** - All-in-one linter/formatter (faster, simpler setup, but smaller ecosystem)

*Note: For MVP we'll use ESLint + Prettier for maximum plugin ecosystem support. Biome is tracked as a future alternative when the ecosystem matures.*

### Security Tools (Non-negotiable)
- **TruffleHog** - Pre-commit secret scanning
- **Snyk** - Dependency vulnerability scanning and monitoring
- **Semgrep** - SAST security analysis with OWASP Top 10 rules
- **npm audit** - Built-in dependency security checking

### Testing Framework
- **Vitest** - Primary testing framework (fast, modern Jest alternative)
- **Playwright** - E2E testing and browser automation
- **@testing-library** - Component testing utilities
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** - API mocking for integration tests

### Architecture Enforcement
- **ts-arch** - TypeScript architecture testing and layer enforcement
- **dependency-cruiser** - Dependency analysis and circular dependency detection
- **madge** - Module dependency visualization and validation

### Performance & Monitoring  
- **size-limit** - Bundle size budgets and validation
- **Lighthouse CI** - Performance regression detection
- **Sentry** - Error tracking and performance monitoring (when needed)

### Build & Package Management
- **Bun** - Package manager and runtime (as specified in user preferences)
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server
- **Moon** - Monorepo build orchestration (when applicable)

## Development Setup Requirements

### Git Hooks and Quality Gates

- **Conventional Commits** - Commit message formatting with commitizen
- **Pre-commit hooks**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript check, secret scanning
- **Pre-push hooks**: Full test suite, security audit, architecture validation

### Claude Code Integration
- Create specialized Claude Agents for the project
- Setup custom Claude Commands:
  - `/project:mission` - Create Mission and Goals documents
  - `/epic:plan` - Epic planning and task breakdown
  - `/epic:validate` - Architecture and scope validation
  - `/quality:check` - Comprehensive quality validation
- Configure the `agent` folder structure:
  ```
  agent/
  â”œâ”€â”€ epics/          # Epic planning documents
  â”œâ”€â”€ notes/          # Research and analysis notes  
  â”œâ”€â”€ reports/        # Implementation and quality reports
  â”œâ”€â”€ temp/           # Temporary files and experiments
  â””â”€â”€ dashboard/      # Epic monitoring TUI (future)
  ```
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md with:
  - Project architecture patterns
  - Quality standards and validation rules
  - Tool usage guidelines
  - Security requirements
  - Performance benchmarks

### CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- **GitHub Actions** workflows for:
  - Comprehensive quality gates
  - Multi-stage security scanning  
  - Performance regression testing
  - Automated dependency updates
  - Release automation with conventional-changelog

### Claude Code Hooks Configuration

Integration using Claude Code's hook system for quality gates:

#### PostToolUse Hooks
```json
{
  "PostToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Write|Edit",  
      "command": "./scripts/post-edit-validation.sh"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### PreToolUse Hooks  
```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Write.*\\.ts$|Edit.*\\.ts$",
      "command": "./scripts/pre-typescript-validation.sh" 
    }
  ]
}
```

#### SessionStart Hooks
```json
{
  "SessionStart": [
    {
      "command": "./scripts/load-project-context.sh"
    }
  ]
}
```

*Scripts will handle tool orchestration (lint, typecheck, security scan) with fast responses via background daemon.*

## Hyper Coding Workflow

1. **Project Setup**: Automated initialization with quality controls
2. **Pattern Definition**: Establish architectural patterns and coding standards
3. **Template Creation**: Install relevant hypergen templates and instruct the agent to use them
4. **Controlled Generation**: Claude Code hooks run automated checks and provide instant feedback to Claude, before the final answer.
   Hooks may also demand user intervention when certain signals are detected in the Claude Code output but a decision cannot be made automatically.
5. **Continuous Validation**: `hyper dev` daemon monitors changes in the project, runs quality checks, and provides relevant data for the Claude Code hooks scripts

## Quality Control System Implementation

### Automated Quality Gates (Level 1 - Essential)
Following the research findings for immediate implementation:

#### Pre-Commit Validation
- **Linting**: ESLint with security and complexity rules
- **Formatting**: Prettier auto-formatting
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode compilation
- **Secret Detection**: TruffleHog scanning
- **Architecture**: ts-arch boundary enforcement

#### Pre-Push Validation

## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans

### Technical Risks
- **Hook Performance Impact**: Monitor hook execution time, optimize slow validations
- **False Positives**: Tune security scanning rules, implement ignore patterns
- **Developer Resistance**: Gradual rollout, clear benefit communication
- **Tool Integration Conflicts**: Version pinning, compatibility testing

### Process Risks  
- **Quality Gate Failures**: Clear error messages, fix suggestions
- **Scope Creep**: Strict boundary enforcement, regular alignment checks
- **Context Loss**: Session hooks, persistent project state
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Comprehensive documentation, team training

## Background Monitoring Daemon: `hyper dev`

**Problem**: Hook validation (TypeScript, linting, security scans) takes 10-30 seconds, killing development flow.

**Solution**: Background daemon pre-computes validation data, hooks query cached results in <100ms.

### Core Capabilities
- **File watching** with incremental analysis
- **Pre-computed validation cache** (TypeScript errors, security issues, architecture violations)
- **Fast IPC API** for hook script consumption
- **Project state awareness** for Claude context

### Implementation
- Phase 2 addition after basic hooks prove methodology
- File watcher + HTTP API + caching layer + process management
- Transforms hook experience from "wait for validation" to "instant feedback"

**Future**: ML pattern detection, predictive analysis, team analytics
