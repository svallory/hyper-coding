# HyperDev Constraints and Architecture

This document outlines the constraints, architectural principles, and core component specifications for HyperDev.

## Constraints and Principles

### Technical Constraints
- **Claude Code First**: Initially support only Claude Code integration
- **JS/TS Focus**: Start with JavaScript/TypeScript, expand later
- **Quality Non-Negotiable**: Never sacrifice code quality for speed
- **Security by Default**: All features must consider security implications

### Scope Constraints
- **Not a Replacement**: Enhance existing tools, don't replace entire development stacks
- **Not a Platform**: Focus on methodology and tooling, not hosting or deployment
- **Not One-Size-Fits-All**: Provide flexibility for different project types and team sizes
- **Not Magic**: Transparent processes that developers can understand and modify

### Philosophical Constraints
- **Developer Agency**: Developers must remain in control of all decisions
- **Explicit Over Implicit**: All automation should be clearly documented and configurable
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to do fewer things excellently than many things poorly
- **Community Over Vendor Lock-in**: Leverage open source ecosystems, avoid proprietary dependencies

## Core Components

### HyperGen (Code Generation Engine)

Enhanced version of the proven Hypergen tool with:

- Advanced template validation and security
- Multi-source template discovery and management
- Integration with quality control systems
- AI-assisted template creation and optimization

### Claude Code Integration

- **Memory Management**: Project context preservation across sessions
- **Hook System**: Automated quality control at every interaction point  
- **Custom Commands**: Project-specific workflows and automation
- **Agent Specialization**: Dedicated AI agents for different development tasks

### Development Environment Setup
- **Project Initialization**: One-command setup with all necessary tools
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific settings and secrets
- **Dependency Management**: Smart package selection and security monitoring
- **Build Optimization**: Fast, reliable builds with quality validation

## Goal Implementation Details

### Goal 1: Make Setting Up a New Project Easy

- Offering a "hands-off" setup where we pick everything for the user
- Offer a guided setup 
- Allow the user to choose the tools they want while avoiding choice paralysis by:
  - Having a clear recommendation based on previous choices
  - Indicators along each tool choice (Github stars, number of issues, last published date)
  - Presenting the most relevant pros and cons of each tool
- Setup the chosen tools automatically

### Goal 2: Deliver Stellar DX from the Start

For our first release, everything will be constrained to:

- Languages: TypeScript, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Sass
- Runtime: node, bun, browser
- Repository: Github
- CI: Github
- All other tools must belong to this ecosystem
