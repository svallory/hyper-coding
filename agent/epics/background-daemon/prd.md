# Background Daemon Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Quality validation hooks take 10-30 seconds, destroying development flow and making real-time feedback impractical for Claude Code integration.

**Solution**: `hyper dev` background daemon that pre-computes validation results, enabling <100ms hook responses and instant quality feedback.

**Value**: Transform hooks from development burden to development accelerator, enabling true real-time quality validation.

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements

**Core Daemon Features**:

1. **File Watching** - Monitor project files with efficient change detection
2. **Incremental Analysis** - Process only changed files and dependencies
3. **Validation Cache** - Store pre-computed results for instant retrieval
4. **IPC API** - HTTP/JSON API for hook script communication
5. **Process Management** - Start, stop, restart, health monitoring
6. **Project Context** - Maintain awareness of project state and structure

**Validation Capabilities**:

1. **TypeScript Analysis** - Type errors, warnings, compilation status
2. **ESLint Results** - Code quality issues, security warnings, complexity metrics
3. **Security Scanning** - TruffleHog secrets, Snyk vulnerabilities, Semgrep findings
4. **Architecture Validation** - ts-arch boundaries, circular dependencies
5. **Test Status** - Test results, coverage data, failure analysis
6. **Build Status** - Compilation errors, bundle analysis, dependency issues

**User Workflows**:

1. **Daemon Lifecycle**: `hyper dev start` → background analysis → `hyper dev stop`
2. **Hook Integration**: Claude hooks query daemon API for instant validation results
3. **Development Flow**: File changes → incremental analysis → updated cache → hook queries

### Technical Requirements

**Performance**: 
- Startup analysis <5 seconds for typical projects
- Incremental updates <500ms after file changes  
- API response time <100ms for all queries
- Memory usage <100MB, CPU usage <5% when idle

**Reliability**:
- Graceful handling of file system events
- Recovery from analysis failures without crashing
- Automatic restart on unexpected termination
- Clean shutdown with resource cleanup

**Scalability**:
- Handle projects with 10,000+ files efficiently
- Support multiple concurrent API clients
- Efficient memory usage for long-running processes
- Incremental analysis to avoid full rescans

**Integration**:
- HTTP API for language-agnostic hook integration
- JSON structured data for easy consumption
- File path normalization for cross-platform compatibility
- Git integration for change detection optimization

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Usability**: Simple start/stop commands, clear status indicators, helpful error messages
**Reliability**: Robust error handling, automatic recovery, minimal resource leaks
**Maintainability**: Clean Go architecture, comprehensive logging, testable components
**Security**: No secret exposure, secure API endpoints, safe file system access

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Architecture

**Core Components**:
- **File Watcher**: fsnotify-based efficient file change detection
- **Analysis Engine**: Pluggable analyzers for different validation types
- **Cache Manager**: In-memory cache with optional persistence
- **API Server**: HTTP server with JSON API for hook communication
- **Process Manager**: Daemon lifecycle, health monitoring, graceful shutdown

**Data Flow**:
1. File Watcher detects changes → Analysis Engine processes updates → Cache Manager stores results → API Server serves queries
2. Hook Scripts → HTTP API → Cache Lookup → JSON Response → Instant Feedback

**API Design**:
```go
GET /api/v1/validation/typescript    // Get TypeScript analysis results
GET /api/v1/validation/eslint       // Get ESLint results  
GET /api/v1/validation/security     // Get security scan results
GET /api/v1/validation/architecture // Get architecture validation
GET /api/v1/project/status          // Get overall project health
GET /api/v1/daemon/health           // Get daemon status
```

### Development Phases

**Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure**: File watching, basic HTTP API, TypeScript analysis
**Phase 2 - Validation Integration**: ESLint, security tools, architecture validation
**Phase 3 - Performance Optimization**: Caching strategies, incremental analysis, resource optimization
**Phase 4 - Advanced Features**: Test integration, build status, git awareness

### Dependencies & Risks

**Technical Dependencies**:
- Go CLI foundation for daemon management
- Quality tools (ESLint, TypeScript, security scanners) integration
- File system APIs for cross-platform file watching

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive error handling for analysis tool failures
- Resource limits to prevent memory/CPU overconsumption
- Graceful degradation when analysis tools unavailable
- Cross-platform testing for file system differences

## Success Criteria

**Measurable Outcomes**:
- Hook response time <100ms consistently
- Daemon startup time <5 seconds for typical projects
- Memory usage stable under 100MB during normal operation
- File change detection accuracy 100% for relevant file types
- Zero crashes during normal development workflows

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `hyper dev` starts daemon with clear status indication
- File changes trigger incremental analysis within 500ms
- Hook scripts get instant responses with current validation status
- Daemon shuts down cleanly without leaving processes or files
- Cross-platform compatibility verified on Windows, macOS, Linux

**Testing Strategy**:
- File watching stress testing with rapid file changes
- API load testing with concurrent hook requests
- Memory leak testing for long-running daemon processes
- Cross-platform testing for file system compatibility
- Integration testing with real Claude Code hook scenarios
