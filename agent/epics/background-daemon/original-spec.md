# Background Daemon - Original Specification

## Context & Problem

**Problem**: Hook validation (TypeScript, linting, security scans) takes 10-30 seconds, killing development flow and making Claude Code hooks impractical for real-time feedback.

**Current Pain**: Developers wait for validation → lose flow state → reduced productivity → hooks become burdensome rather than helpful.

## Solution: `hyper dev` Background Daemon

**Concept**: Background daemon pre-computes validation data, hooks query cached results in <100ms, transforming "wait for validation" to "instant feedback."

### Core Architecture
- **File watching** with incremental analysis
- **Pre-computed validation cache** (TypeScript errors, security issues, architecture violations)
- **Fast IPC API** for hook script consumption (<100ms)
- **Project state awareness** for Claude context

### User Experience
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start daemon
$ hyper dev
🚀 HyperDev daemon started
📁 Watching project files...
🔍 Initial analysis complete (2.3s)
✅ Ready for instant validation

# Terminal 2: Development continues normally
# Claude Code hooks now get <100ms responses
# No waiting, no interruption, instant quality feedback
```

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Targets
- **Startup Analysis**: Complete project scan in <5 seconds
- **Incremental Updates**: File change processing in <500ms
- **Hook Response**: API queries answered in <100ms
- **Resource Usage**: <100MB RAM, <5% CPU idle

### Core Capabilities
- **TypeScript Analysis**: Pre-computed type errors and warnings
- **Security Scanning**: Cached TruffleHog, Snyk, Semgrep results
- **Architecture Validation**: ts-arch boundaries, dependency analysis
- **Project Context**: File structure, recent changes, git state

## Dependencies
- **Hypergen V8**: For understanding project templates and structure
- **Go CLI**: Shared daemon management and lifecycle
- **HyperDev Templates**: For understanding quality gate configurations

## Success Criteria
- Hooks provide instant feedback without development interruption
- Daemon starts quickly and uses minimal system resources
- File watching accurately detects all relevant changes
- Crash recovery maintains development continuity
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Strategic Value
Transforms Claude Code hooks from "nice to have" to "essential development accelerator" by eliminating the performance barrier that prevents real-time quality validation.
