# Go CLI Development - Original Specification

## Context & Requirements

**Objective**: Create a beautiful, fast CLI tool that wraps the npm-distributed `@hyperdev/hypergen` package, providing excellent developer experience while leveraging Go's performance advantages.

## Core Requirements

### CLI Architecture
- **Go-based CLI** (`hyper`) for performance and beautiful terminal UX
- **Charmbracelet libraries** for modern terminal interface (Bubble Tea, Lip Gloss, Bubbles)
- **Subprocess integration** with `@hyperdev/hypergen` npm package
- **Auto-installation** of hypergen if not present
- **Cross-platform** support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Integration Model
```bash
# User experience
$ hyper gen hyper-coding-stack
âœ¨ hypergen not found. Install @hyperdev/hypergen globally? (y/N) y  
ðŸ“¦ Installing @hyperdev/hypergen...
âœ… Generating Hyper Coding project...
```

### Technical Approach
- Go CLI handles UX, npm-distributed hypergen handles generation
- JSON communication between Go and hypergen subprocess
- Proper error handling and exit code propagation
- Beautiful progress indicators and status messages

## Dependencies
- **Hypergen V8**: Need basic hypergen functionality (30% completion)
- **Template system**: For testing CLI with real templates

## Success Criteria
- Fast, intuitive CLI that feels native
- Seamless hypergen integration without user awareness of subprocess
- Beautiful terminal output with progress indicators
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Integration with HyperDev Workflow
This CLI becomes the primary interface for the Hyper Coding methodology, replacing direct hypergen usage for most developers.
