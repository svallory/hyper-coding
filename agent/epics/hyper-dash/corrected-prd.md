# HyperDash - Remaining Implementation Tasks

## Executive Summary
**Current Status**: HyperDash implementation is 85% complete with 2,441+ lines of Go code already implemented using Charmbracelet ecosystem.

**Remaining Work**: Focus on missing features, npm distribution, testing improvements, and UI enhancements based on the detailed 6-tab structure from ui-structure.md.

## What's Already Implemented âœ…

### Core Infrastructure
- Complete Go project structure with proper modules
- Charmbracelet dependencies (Bubbletea v1.3.9, Bubbles v0.21.0, Lipgloss v1.1.0, Glamour v0.6.0)
- Cobra CLI integration with --epic and --test flags
- fsnotify file watching system for real-time updates
- Epic discovery and loading from agent/epics/ directories
- Professional Lipgloss styling system

### TUI Implementation
- Bubbletea Elm Architecture with proper Init/Update/View pattern
- 5 view modes: EpicListView, EpicDetailView, LogsView, DocumentsView, HelpView
- Bubbles list component for epic display
- Viewport integration for scrollable content
- Real-time file monitoring and UI updates
- Spinner loading states and progress indicators
- Comprehensive keyboard navigation

### Data Models & Features
- Epic model with workflow state parsing
- Log entry model with real-time streaming
- Document discovery and markdown rendering
- Error handling for malformed data
- Headless testing mode
- Simulation scripts for testing

### Testing & Integration
- Moon build system integration (moon.yml)
- Comprehensive test scripts (quick-test.sh, simulate-epic.sh)
- Headless mode for CI/CD
- Go standard tooling integration

## Remaining Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: UI Structure Alignment (3-4 tasks)
The current implementation has 5 view modes but the UI design specifies 6 tabs with different layouts.

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (2-3 tasks)  
- Enhanced tab system with numbered shortcuts (1-6)
- Vi-mode keyboard navigation support
- Advanced table features (sorting, filtering)
- Task Master CLI integration for task display

### Phase 3: Distribution & Polish (2-3 tasks)
- Cross-platform binary compilation (GitHub Actions)
- npm package wrapper for easy installation
- Performance optimizations and caching
- Production-ready error handling

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation (1-2 tasks)
- Comprehensive test coverage for new features
- Update documentation for missing features
- Integration testing with epic workflows

## Task Generation Guidelines

### Focus Areas for Remaining Work:
1. **UI Alignment**: Match the 6-tab structure from ui-structure.md
2. **Distribution**: Complete cross-platform npm distribution
3. **Advanced Navigation**: Vi-mode and enhanced keyboard shortcuts  
4. **Task Integration**: TaskMaster CLI integration for real-time task display
5. **Performance**: Optimization and production readiness
6. **Testing**: Coverage for new features

### What NOT to Include:
- Basic Go project setup (already done)
- Core Charmbracelet integration (already done)
- Basic file watching (already done)
- Epic discovery (already done)
- Basic TUI framework (already done)

### Complexity Targets:
- **Simple Tasks**: UI tweaks, configuration changes (1-2 days)
- **Medium Tasks**: New tab implementation, enhanced features (2-3 days)
- **Complex Tasks**: Distribution setup, advanced integrations (3-5 days)

## Success Criteria
- 6-tab UI structure matching ui-structure.md specification
- npm install hyperdash works cross-platform
- Vi-mode navigation support
- Task Master integration shows real-time task status
- Performance remains under 50MB memory usage
- All existing functionality preserved and enhanced
