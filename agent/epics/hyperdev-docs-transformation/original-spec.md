# Original Epic Specification: HyperDev Documentation Transformation

## User Request
Take the findings from the documentation analysis and make a plan to fix them. Understand that we are creating the documentation to define how the tool _will_ be. We are way past what is currently implemented. So ignore the implementation and focus on documenting an ideal yet attainable tool.

## Documentation Analysis Findings Summary

### Critical Issues Identified
- **Content Architecture**: Navigation inconsistencies, missing cross-references, fragmented tool documentation
- **Content Quality**: Installation guide incomplete, getting started assumes too much knowledge, outdated examples
- **User Experience**: No clear user journey, missing quick wins, poor progressive disclosure
- **Technical Standards**: Inconsistent frontmatter, underutilized Mintlify components, missing alt text
- **Coverage Gaps**: Missing essential tutorials, migration guides, debugging documentation, architecture overviews

### Context
- HyperDev is a modern code generator built on TypeScript with Moon build system integration
- Current documentation is Mintlify-based with ~40 pages but many incomplete or placeholder
- Focus is on documenting the ideal, attainable vision rather than current implementation status
- Documentation should define how the tool will work to guide both users and development

### Scope
Transform existing documentation into comprehensive, user-journey-focused system that serves both current and planned HyperDev capabilities while maintaining Mintlify platform and existing structure.
