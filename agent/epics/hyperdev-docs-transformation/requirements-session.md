# Requirements Session: hyperdev-docs-transformation

## User Problem Definition

**Q1**: What specific problem does this solve?
**A1**: Current HyperDev documentation is incomplete, inconsistent, and fails to guide users from discovery to productivity. Users cannot effectively learn, adopt, or master the HyperDev ecosystem, limiting adoption and success rates.

**Q2**: Who experiences this problem and how often?
**A2**: 
- **New Developers**: Daily frustration trying to understand what HyperDev is and how to start
- **Evaluating Teams**: Cannot assess HyperDev's capabilities for their use cases
- **Existing Users**: Struggle to find information about advanced features and patterns
- **Community Contributors**: Cannot easily contribute templates or integrations due to unclear processes

**Q3**: What's the cost of not solving this?
**A3**: 
- **Lost User Adoption**: Potential users abandon evaluation due to poor documentation
- **Increased Support Burden**: Repetitive support requests for undocumented features
- **Slower Development**: Team spends time explaining instead of building
- **Community Fragmentation**: Contributors create incompatible solutions due to lack of guidance

## Solution Scope

**Q4**: What's the minimal viable solution?
**A4**: Transform the existing 40+ documentation pages into a coherent, accurate, and comprehensive system that serves both current and planned HyperDev capabilities with clear feature status indicators.

**Q5**: What would "done" look like for users?
**A5**: 
- **New users** can go from "never heard of HyperDev" to productive usage in under 30 minutes
- **Evaluating teams** can assess all capabilities and make informed adoption decisions
- **Current users** can find answers to advanced questions without external support
- **Contributors** have clear processes for template creation, sharing, and best practices

**Q6**: What's explicitly out of scope?
**A6**: 
- Building actual features (documentation defines the vision, implementation follows)
- Changing the Mintlify platform or fundamental site structure
- Creating video content or interactive tutorials beyond code examples
- Translating content to other languages

## Technical Requirements

**Q7**: What are the performance requirements?
**A7**: 
- **Page Load Time**: <2 seconds for any documentation page
- **Search Response**: <500ms for search queries within docs
- **Content Discovery**: Users should find relevant content within 3 clicks
- **Example Execution**: All code examples should be testable and working

**Q8**: What are the security/compliance needs?
**A8**: 
- **Safe Code Examples**: All examples must follow security best practices
- **Privacy Compliance**: No tracking beyond standard Mintlify analytics
- **Access Control**: Public documentation with optional authenticated sections for advanced features
- **Content Integrity**: Version control and change tracking for all content

**Q9**: What external integrations are required?
**A9**: 
- **GitHub Integration**: Links to source code, issues, and examples
- **OpenAPI Integration**: Live API documentation with examples
- **CodeSandbox/Playground**: Interactive code examples where beneficial
- **Community Platforms**: Links to Discord, forums, and community resources

## Implementation Constraints

**Q10**: What's the timeline/deadline pressure?
**A10**: This is foundational work that should be completed before major marketing pushes or user acquisition campaigns. No hard deadline, but quality is critical for long-term success.

**Q11**: What resources are available?
**A11**: 
- **Technical Writing**: Primary focus on developer-oriented technical content
- **Code Examples**: Access to full HyperDev codebase for accurate examples
- **Design Assets**: Existing branding, logos, and Mintlify theme
- **Subject Matter Expertise**: Deep knowledge of HyperDev architecture and vision

**Q12**: What can't change in existing systems?
**A12**: 
- **Mintlify Platform**: Must remain on current documentation platform
- **URL Structure**: Existing URLs should be preserved or properly redirected
- **Branding/Theme**: Current visual design and branding must be maintained
- **API Integration**: OpenAPI spec integration must be preserved and enhanced

## Advanced Requirements Analysis

### **User Journey Requirements**

**Primary User Journeys**:
1. **Discovery Journey**: "What is HyperDev?" → "Should I use this?" → "How do I start?"
2. **Onboarding Journey**: "Install" → "First success" → "Understanding concepts" → "Real project"
3. **Mastery Journey**: "Advanced patterns" → "Performance optimization" → "Contributing back"
4. **Integration Journey**: "Adding to existing project" → "Team adoption" → "Enterprise deployment"

### **Content Architecture Requirements**

**Information Architecture**:
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Content complexity increases gradually
- **Multiple Entry Points**: Users can start from different knowledge levels
- **Cross-Reference Network**: Rich internal linking for discovery
- **Consistent Patterns**: Similar content types follow same structure

**Content Types Required**:
- **Conceptual**: What is X and why does it matter?
- **Procedural**: How do I accomplish Y?
- **Reference**: What are all the options for Z?
- **Troubleshooting**: What do I do when W goes wrong?
- **Examples**: Show me real implementations

### **Feature Documentation Requirements**

**Current Feature Documentation**:
- Complete coverage of all working functionality
- Accurate code examples tested against current implementation
- Clear limitations and known issues
- Performance characteristics and best practices

**Planned Feature Documentation**:
- Clear labeling as "Coming Soon" or "Planned"
- Link to implementation roadmap/timeline
- Explanation of why the feature matters
- Examples of how it will work (mockups/prototypes)

**Integration Documentation**:
- Moon build system integration patterns
- Task Master AI workflow documentation
- CLI tool ecosystem interaction
- Third-party tool integration guides

### **Technical Writing Requirements**

**Style Guide**:
- **Tone**: Professional but approachable, avoid jargon where possible
- **Voice**: Second person ("you") for procedures, third person for concepts
- **Code Style**: Follow existing HyperDev conventions, include comments
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Consistent heading structure, callouts, and formatting

**Quality Standards**:
- **Accuracy**: All examples must be tested and working
- **Completeness**: No "TODO" sections or placeholder content
- **Consistency**: Similar content follows same structure and patterns
- **Accessibility**: Alt text, semantic markup, readable color contrast

### **Platform-Specific Requirements**

**Mintlify Optimization**:

## Gap Analysis and Missing Information

### **Identified Gaps**:

1. **User Personas**: Need to define specific developer archetypes and their needs
2. **Success Metrics**: How will we measure documentation effectiveness?
3. **Maintenance Strategy**: How will docs stay current as HyperDev evolves?
4. **Community Contribution**: What's the process for community-generated content?
5. **Localization**: Any future plans for multi-language support?

### **Assumptions Made**:

1. **English Only**: Documentation will be in English initially
2. **Developer Audience**: Primary audience is software developers
3. **Open Source**: Content should reflect open source community values
4. **Modern Stack**: Users are familiar with modern development tools and practices

### **Risk Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Content Validation**: Regular review cycles with actual users
2. **Example Testing**: Automated testing of code examples
3. **Feedback Collection**: Clear channels for user feedback and suggestions
4. **Version Management**: Clear versioning strategy for major updates
