# Project Assessment for HyperDev Templates & Methodology

## Codebase Analysis

**Architecture**: Moon monorepo with existing hypergen package and template system foundation
**Technology Stack**: TypeScript, Bun, Moon build system, existing template discovery and execution
**Template System**: Current hypergen template support with frontmatter, needs V8 composition features
**Build Integration**: Moon task orchestration already established, need to extend for quality gates

## Current State Analysis

**Existing Template Foundation**:
- `packages/hypergen/` - Core template engine with EJS rendering
- Template discovery system with npm and GitHub integration
- Basic CLI with template execution capabilities
- Moon workspace configuration in `.moon/workspace.yml`

**Quality Tools Analysis**:
- Some ESLint configuration exists in hypergen package
- TypeScript compilation already integrated with Moon
- Missing: Comprehensive quality gate integration
- Missing: Security tool configurations
- Missing: Architecture validation setup

**Moon Integration Points**:
- Existing workspace structure supports multiple packages
- Task configuration patterns established
- Need to extend task definitions for quality gates
- CI/CD integration patterns already in use

## Technical Implementation Context

**Template Composition Requirements**:
- Need Hypergen V8 template composition for modular tool assembly
- Template.yml system for rich variable configuration
- Conditional template inclusion based on user choices
- URL-based template includes for reusable components

**Quality Gate Integration**:
```
Moon Tasks → Quality Tools → Validation → Reporting
├── :lint (ESLint + Prettier)
├── :typecheck (TypeScript strict)
├── :test (Vitest + Playwright)
├── :security (TruffleHog + Snyk + Semgrep)
└── :arch (ts-arch + dependency-cruiser)
```

**Claude Code Integration Points**:
- Hook scripts in `.claude/hooks/`
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md with project patterns
- Custom commands for methodology workflows
- Session context management for project state

## Development Environment Assessment

**Existing Tooling**:
- Bun package manager (user preference)
- Moon build orchestration
- TypeScript compilation pipeline
- Basic testing with Vitest

**Missing Components**:
- Comprehensive ESLint security rules
- Security scanning tool integration
- Architecture boundary enforcement
- Performance monitoring setup
- Playwright E2E testing configuration

## Integration Architecture

**Template Generation Flow**:
```
User Command → Template Selection → Tool Composition → Moon Configuration → Quality Gate Setup → Claude Integration
```

**Quality Gate Flow**:
```
Code Change → Pre-commit Hooks → Quality Validation → Feedback → Commit/Block
```

## Technical Constraints

**Performance Requirements**:
- Template generation must complete in <2 minutes
- Quality gates must provide feedback in <30 seconds
- Moon task execution must remain fast for development workflow

**Compatibility Requirements**:
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Multiple Node.js versions
- Various terminal environments
- Team vs individual developer workflows

## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks**:
- Tool configuration complexity may cause setup failures
- Quality gate performance impact on development speed  
- Template composition complexity may create maintenance burden
- Claude Code integration may not work in all environments

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive testing of generated projects
- Performance monitoring and optimization of quality gates
- Modular template design for maintainability
- Fallback modes for Claude Code integration

## Resource Requirements

**Development Skills**: 
- Moon build system expertise
- Quality tool configuration (ESLint, security tools)
- Template composition system design
- Claude Code hook development

**Testing Infrastructure**:
- Cross-platform template generation testing
- Generated project validation in CI
- Performance benchmarking for quality gates
- Real developer feedback collection

## Success Dependencies

**Critical Dependencies**:
- Hypergen V8 template composition system
- Moon build system stability and task orchestration
- Quality tool compatibility and configuration
- Claude Code hook system reliability

**Integration Points**:
- Template system must integrate with existing hypergen discovery
- Quality gates must work with Moon task execution
- Claude Code hooks must enhance rather than replace existing workflow

This assessment establishes the foundation for creating comprehensive templates that implement the complete Hyper Coding methodology while building on existing project infrastructure.
