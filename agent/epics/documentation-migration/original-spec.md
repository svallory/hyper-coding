# Documentation & Migration - Original Specification

## Context & Requirements

**Objective**: Create comprehensive documentation ecosystem and migration tooling to support successful transition to Hypergen V8 and enable effective adoption of the Hyper Coding methodology.

## Core Requirements

### Documentation System
- **API Documentation**: Complete TypeScript API docs with examples
- **User Guides**: Step-by-step guides for template creation, usage, composition
- **Migration Guides**: Clear upgrade paths from current system to V8
- **Methodology Documentation**: Complete Hyper Coding workflow and patterns
- **Troubleshooting**: Comprehensive problem/solution database

### Migration Tooling
- **Template Migration**: Convert frontmatter templates to template.yml format
- **Configuration Migration**: Upgrade existing hypergen projects to V8
- **Validation Tools**: Verify migration completeness and correctness
- **Rollback Support**: Safe downgrade paths if issues encountered

### Documentation Site Architecture
```

```

### User Experience Goals
- **Zero-friction onboarding**: New users productive in <15 minutes
- **Self-service migration**: Existing users can upgrade independently
- **Clear error resolution**: Every error message links to solution
- **Progressive disclosure**: Learn as you go, not everything upfront

## Dependencies
- **All Other Epics**: Need stable APIs and features to document (80% completion)
- **Hypergen V8**: Core features for API documentation
- **Templates**: Real examples for documentation
- **Go CLI**: Command documentation and examples

## Success Criteria
- Complete API documentation with 100% coverage
- Migration tools successfully upgrade 100% of test projects
- New user onboarding time <15 minutes from docs
- Zero unresolved documentation issues or gaps
- Clear upgrade path for all existing hypergen users

## Strategic Value
Enables successful adoption by removing documentation and migration barriers that typically prevent teams from upgrading to new systems. Essential for community growth and methodology adoption.
