# Claude Code Integration & Hooks - Original Specification

## Context & Requirements

**Objective**: Create comprehensive Claude Code integration that enables real-time quality validation, methodology enforcement, and enhanced development experience through intelligent hooks and custom commands.

## Core Requirements

### Hook System Integration
- **PostToolUse Hooks**: Immediate validation after code changes (Write, Edit, MultiEdit)
- **PreToolUse Hooks**: Architecture and scope validation before generation
- **SessionStart Hooks**: Project context loading and methodology setup
- **Custom Commands**: `/project:mission`, `/epic:plan`, `/quality:check`

### Hook Performance Strategy
With Background Daemon:
```bash
PostToolUse Hook → Daemon API Query → <100ms Response → Instant Feedback
```

Without Background Daemon:
```bash
PostToolUse Hook → Fast Validation Only → Defer Heavy Analysis → Background Reports
```

### Custom Command System
```bash
/project:mission    # Define objectives and scope boundaries
/epic:plan         # Task breakdown with dependency analysis  
/quality:check     # Comprehensive validation with detailed report
/hyper:status      # Current project health and methodology compliance
```

## Technical Implementation

### Hook Script Architecture
```

├── post-tool-use/
│   ├── validate-typescript.sh      # Type checking
│   ├── security-scan.sh           # Secret detection
│   ├── architecture-check.sh      # Boundary validation
│   └── format-check.sh            # Code formatting

│   ├── scope-validation.sh        # Architecture scope check
│   └── mission-alignment.sh       # Objective validation
└── session-start/
    ├── load-context.sh            # Project context loading
    └── methodology-status.sh      # Setup validation
```

### Enhanced CLAUDE.md Templates
- **Project Architecture**: Patterns, boundaries, conventions
- **Quality Standards**: Validation rules, performance benchmarks
- **Security Requirements**: Scanning rules, compliance standards  
- **Methodology Guidelines**: Hyper Coding workflow, epic management

## Dependencies
- **HyperDev Templates**: For CLAUDE.md template generation (60%)
- **Background Daemon**: For instant hook responses (optional but recommended)
- **Quality Tools**: ESLint, TypeScript, security scanners integration

## Success Criteria
- Hooks provide instant feedback without development interruption
- Custom commands enhance rather than complicate development workflow  
- CLAUDE.md templates enable accurate AI assistance
- Integration works seamlessly across different project types
- Quality validation becomes invisible when it works

## Strategic Value
Transforms Claude Code from generic AI assistant to specialized development methodology enforcer, ensuring consistent quality and architectural integrity across all development work.
