# HyperDev Development Orchestration Plan

## Work Division for Concurrent Development

After comprehensive analysis of all project documentation, this plan divides the HyperDev development effort into 6 concurrent epics optimized for parallel execution using separate git worktrees and Claude Code sessions.

## Current State Analysis
- **Hypergen V8**: Lost implementation needs complete rebuild with strict mission alignment
- **HyperDev Methodology**: Well-defined 4-phase technical implementation plan
- **Foundation**: Strong existing hypergen codebase with working CLI, discovery, trust, and caching systems

## Epic Structure

### Epic 1: **Hypergen V8 Foundation Recovery** 
*Duration: 2-3 months | Priority: Critical | Dependencies: None*

**Scope**: Rebuild lost V8 core features with mission alignment filter
- Template.yml configuration system with rich variables
- Template composition engine with URL-based includes  
- Enhanced CLI commands and validation
- Creator trust system integration
- LiquidJS template engine integration
- Action system with decorators

**Team**: 2 developers (1 senior, 1 mid-level) → **2 Claude Code sessions**
**Output**: Feature-complete `@hyperdev/hypergen` npm package

### Epic 2: **Go CLI Development**
*Duration: 1-2 months | Priority: High | Dependencies: Partial Epic 1*

**Scope**: Beautiful, fast CLI that wraps hypergen via subprocess
- Go CLI using Charmbracelet libraries for UX
- npm integration (auto-install @hyperdev/hypergen)
- JSON output modes for programmatic use
- Subprocess optimization and error handling

**Team**: 1 Go developer → **1 Claude Code session**
**Output**: `hyper` CLI with npm-distributed hypergen engine

### Epic 3: **HyperDev Templates & Methodology**
*Duration: 2-3 months | Priority: High | Dependencies: Epic 1 (50%), Epic 2 (30%)*

**Scope**: Complete Hyper Coding methodology templates
- MVP tool stack template (ESLint, TypeScript, Vitest, etc.)
- Moon monorepo configuration
- Claude Code hooks and validation scripts
- Quality gate automation

**Team**: 1 senior developer + DevOps/tooling specialist → **1 Claude Code session**
**Output**: One-command Hyper Coding methodology setup

### Epic 4: **Background Daemon (`hyper dev`)**
*Duration: 2-3 months | Priority: Medium | Dependencies: Epic 1 (80%), Epic 2 (50%)*

**Scope**: Background monitoring for instant validation feedback
- File watching with incremental analysis
- Pre-computed validation cache
- Fast IPC API for hooks (<100ms response)
- Project state management

**Team**: 1 senior systems developer → **1 Claude Code session**
**Output**: Background daemon enabling instant hook responses

### Epic 5: **Claude Code Integration & Hooks**
*Duration: 1-2 months | Priority: High | Dependencies: Epic 3 (60%), Epic 4 (optional)*

**Scope**: Complete Claude Code integration
- Hook script library (PostToolUse, PreToolUse, SessionStart)
- Custom commands (/project:mission, /epic:plan, /quality:check)
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md templates
- Agent specialization setup

**Team**: 1 developer with Claude Code expertise → **1 Claude Code session**
**Output**: Complete hook ecosystem for Hyper Coding

### Epic 6: **Documentation & Migration**
*Duration: 1-2 months | Priority: Medium | Dependencies: All others (80%)*

**Scope**: Comprehensive documentation and migration support
- API documentation and guides
- Migration tools (frontmatter → template.yml)
- Tutorial content and examples
- Community onboarding materials

**Team**: 1 technical writer + 1 developer for tooling → **1 Claude Code session**
**Output**: Complete documentation ecosystem

## Concurrent Development Strategy

### Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Foundation
- **Epic 1** (Hypergen V8): Start immediately - core foundation
- **Epic 2** (Go CLI): Start week 2 - can work with basic hypergen interface
- **Epic 3** (Templates): Start week 3 - needs basic template.yml support

### Phase 2 (Months 2-3): Integration  
- **Epic 4** (Daemon): Start month 2 - needs core hypergen stability
- **Epic 5** (Hooks): Start month 2 - can work with basic templates
- **Epic 6** (Docs): Start month 2.5 - needs stable APIs

## Key Dependencies
1. **Epic 1 → All others**: Core hypergen features needed by everyone
2. **Epic 2 + Epic 3 → Epic 5**: CLI and templates needed for hook development
3. **Epic 4 → Epic 5**: Daemon enhances but doesn't block hook development

## Git Worktree Strategy

Each epic will be developed in its own git worktree with dedicated Claude Code sessions:

```bash
# Example worktree structure
hyperdev-epic1/     # Hypergen V8 Foundation
hyperdev-epic2/     # Go CLI Development  
hyperdev-epic3/     # HyperDev Templates
hyperdev-epic4/     # Background Daemon
hyperdev-epic5/     # Claude Integration
hyperdev-epic6/     # Documentation
```

## Risk Mitigation
- **Epic 1 is critical path**: Prioritize with senior developers
- **Independent work streams**: Go CLI, documentation can proceed in parallel
- **Incremental integration**: Each epic produces usable incremental value
- **Mission alignment filter**: Prevent scope creep that caused original V8 loss

## Success Criteria

### Integration Checkpoints
- **Month 1**: Epic 1 provides stable template.yml system for Epic 3
- **Month 2**: Epic 2 + Epic 1 integration working for basic generation
- **Month 3**: All epics producing integrated functionality

### Quality Gates
- Each epic maintains independent test suites
- Integration testing at epic boundaries
- Regular cross-epic sync meetings
- Shared mission alignment validation

This orchestration plan enables massive parallel development while maintaining integration coherence and delivering incremental value throughout the development process.
