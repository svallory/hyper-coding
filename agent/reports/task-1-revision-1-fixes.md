# Task #1 Revision 1: Critical Documentation Fixes

## Summary

Agent A-R1 successfully addressed all critical issues identified in the Task #1 review assessment. All 2/5 missing root pages were created and all non-working examples were fixed to use verified, working commands.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Non-Working Examples → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Documentation contained examples that immediately failed when users tried them.

**Fixed Examples**:
- ❌ `hypergen starlight create --name=my-docs` (Action 'create' not found)
- ✅ `hypergen starlight --preset=full-featured --projectFolder=my-docs` (Verified working)

**Files Modified**:
- `/docs/src/content/docs/index.mdoc`
- `/docs/src/content/docs/getting-started.mdoc`
- `/docs/src/content/docs/overview.mdoc`
- `/docs/src/content/docs/faq.mdoc`

**Verification**: Tested the corrected command successfully:
```bash
$ bun run hygen starlight --preset=full-featured --projectFolder=test-docs
✅ Template executed successfully, generated 11 files using preset 'full-featured'
```

### 🚨 CRITICAL: CLI Command Inaccuracies → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Basic CLI commands didn't work as documented.

**Fixed Commands**:
- ❌ `hypergen --help` (returns "action not found" error)
- ✅ `hypergen discover` and `hypergen list` (verified working commands)

**Files Modified**:
- `/docs/src/content/docs/getting-started.mdoc` - Updated CLI reference section
- `/docs/src/content/docs/getting-started/installation.mdoc` - Fixed verification commands
- `/docs/src/content/docs/faq.mdoc` - Updated troubleshooting commands

### ❌ MISSING: Required Pages → ✅ DELIVERED
**Problem**: 2 of 5 required root pages were missing.

**Created/Moved Files**:
1. ✅ `/docs/src/content/docs/overview.mdoc` - Comprehensive "What is Hypergen" page
2. ✅ `/docs/src/content/docs/faq.mdoc` - Frequently asked questions page

**Source**: Both files were moved from `/test/temp/npm-integration/docs/src/content/docs/` and updated to fix non-working commands within their content.

### ⚠️ MODERATE: V8 Decorator References → ✅ CLEANED
**Problem**: Misleading references to `@action()` decorator syntax in current feature documentation.

**Changes Made**:
- Removed "Decorator-Based Actions" from current V8 features in `index.mdoc`
- Replaced with "Enhanced CLI: Advanced command handling and validation"
- Maintained clear separation between working features and planned features
