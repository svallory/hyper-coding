# Recipe Step System CLI Integration Report

## Overview
This report documents the successful integration of the Hypergen V8 Recipe Step System with the CLI commands, enabling users to execute recipes through the command line interface.

## Implementation Summary

### New CLI Commands Added

#### Recipe Commands
1. **`hypergen recipe execute <recipe> [options]`** - Execute a complete recipe with all steps
   - Supports variables: `--name=Button --typescript=true`
   - Supports dry run: `--dryRun`
   - Supports force overwrite: `--force`
   - Supports skip prompts: `--skipPrompts`
   - Supports continue on error: `--continueOnError`

2. **`hypergen recipe validate <recipe>`** - Validate recipe configuration and structure
   - Checks recipe syntax and step definitions
   - Validates variable definitions and dependencies
   - Reports validation errors and warnings

3. **`hypergen recipe info <recipe>`** - Display detailed recipe information
   - Shows recipe metadata (name, version, author, description)
   - Lists all variables with types and requirements
   - Shows all steps with their tools and dependencies
   - Displays example usage patterns

4. **`hypergen recipe list [directory]`** - List available recipes in directory
   - Defaults to `_recipes` directory
   - Shows recipe name, description, and validation status
   - Recursively searches for `.yml` and `.yaml` files

#### Step Commands
1. **`hypergen step list <recipe>`** - List all steps in a recipe
   - Shows step names, descriptions, tools, and dependencies
   - Displays conditional logic and error handling settings
   - Shows tool-specific configuration previews

2. **`hypergen step execute <recipe> <step>`** - Execute a single step from a recipe
   - Allows testing individual steps in isolation
   - Supports same options as recipe execution
   - Creates temporary recipe with just the specified step

### Backward Compatibility Enhancement

Enhanced the existing `hypergen action` command to automatically detect and execute recipe files:

- **Direct Recipe Files**: `hypergen action my-recipe.yml --name=Button`
- **Recipe Name Resolution**: `hypergen action my-component --name=Button`
  - Automatically searches for:
    - `my-component.yml`
    - `my-component.yaml`
    - `_recipes/my-component.yml`
    - `_recipes/my-component.yaml`
- **Maintains Legacy Behavior**: Still works with traditional actions when no recipe is found

### Integration Architecture

#### Core Components Integrated
1. **RecipeEngine**: Main orchestrator for recipe execution
2. **StepExecutor**: Handles step-by-step execution
3. **ToolRegistry**: Manages available tools (template, action, codemod, recipe)
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with helpful suggestions

#### CLI Integration Features
1. **Progress Reporting**: Real-time step execution feedback
2. **File Change Tracking**: Reports created, modified, and deleted files
3. **Variable Resolution**: Interactive prompts for missing required variables
4. **Execution Context**: Proper working directory and environment handling
5. **Dry Run Mode**: Test recipe execution without making changes

### Updated Help System

Enhanced the system help (`hypergen system help`) to include:
- Complete Recipe System command reference
- Step Management command examples
- Flag documentation (`--dryRun`, `--force`, `--skipPrompts`, `--continueOnError`)
- Example usage patterns for both V8 recipes and legacy actions

### Command Examples

#### Recipe Execution Examples
```bash
# Execute complete recipe
hypergen recipe execute my-component.yml --name=Button --typescript=true

# Dry run execution
hypergen recipe execute api-endpoint.yml --dryRun --name=UserAPI

# Execute with force overwrite
hypergen recipe execute full-stack.yml --name=TodoApp --force

# Skip interactive prompts
hypergen recipe execute setup.yml --skipPrompts --continueOnError
```

#### Recipe Management Examples
```bash
# Validate recipe
hypergen recipe validate _recipes/react-component.yml

# Show recipe details
hypergen recipe info _recipes/api-endpoint.yml

# List all recipes
hypergen recipe list _recipes

# List steps in recipe
hypergen step list my-recipe.yml

# Execute single step
hypergen step execute my-recipe.yml generate-component --name=Button
```

#### Backward Compatibility Examples
```bash
# All these work seamlessly with V8 system:
hypergen action my-recipe.yml --name=Button
hypergen action react-component --name=Button --typescript=true
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### CLI Class Enhancements
- Added `RecipeEngine` instance to `HypergenCLI` class
- Integrated recipe engine initialization with existing configuration loading
- Added comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Enhanced parameter parsing to support new recipe-specific flags

### Error Handling Integration
- Recipe validation errors with specific field references
- Step execution errors with context and suggestions
- File operation errors with permissions and path information
- Network errors for external recipe sources

### Progress Reporting
- Real-time step execution status updates
- Duration tracking for performance monitoring
- File change summaries for transparency
- Warning and error aggregation

### Configuration Integration
- Respects existing Hypergen configuration
- Uses working directory from CLI context
- Integrates with logging and output systems
- Supports debug mode activation

## User Benefits

### For Developers
1. **Unified Command Interface**: Single CLI for both legacy actions and V8 recipes
2. **Seamless Migration**: Existing workflows continue to work unchanged
3. **Enhanced Debugging**: Better error messages and dry-run capabilities
4. **Flexible Execution**: Can execute entire recipes or individual steps

### For Recipe Authors
1. **Validation Tools**: Built-in recipe validation and linting
2. **Testing Support**: Individual step execution for development
3. **Documentation**: Automatic help generation from recipe metadata
4. **Discovery**: Easy recipe listing and information display

### For Teams
1. **Consistency**: Standardized recipe execution across environments
2. **Transparency**: Clear reporting of file changes and operations
3. **Safety**: Dry-run mode for safe testing
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback during long-running operations
