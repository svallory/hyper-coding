---

**Implementation Notes**: 
- Some UI tests are failing due to tab count mismatches (expecting 7 tabs, but app has 6) - this is a pre-existing issue unrelated to CI/CD implementation
- Docker testing requires daemon access not available in current environment, but configuration is validated
- All core CI/CD functionality is working and tested
