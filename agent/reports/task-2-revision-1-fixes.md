# Task #2 Revision 1: Getting Started Tutorial Fixes

**Agent:** Agent D-R1 (Revision 1)  
**Task:** Fix critical issues in Agent D's getting started tutorials  
**Date:** August 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Executive Summary

Agent D-R1 successfully fixed all critical technical accuracy issues identified in Agent D's getting started tutorials while preserving the excellent structure and writing quality. The tutorials now reflect the current working state of Hypergen instead of overpromising features and providing non-working examples.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 🚨 Issue 1: Non-Working Command Examples
**Problem**: Installation tutorial referenced `hypergen --version` which shows an error.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Changed to `hypergen --help` with explicit note that error is expected
- ✅ Updated expected output to match reality: "No actions available. Run discovery first"
- ✅ Set proper expectations for new users

### 🚨 Issue 2: Problematic Quick Success Examples  
**Problem**: First template tutorial promised 30-second success but files weren't generated in expected locations.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Kept working npm package example (`hypergen starlight --preset=minimal`) 
- ✅ Added honest note about known file generation issues
- ✅ Provided fallback to local template creation
- ✅ Updated local template section to acknowledge discovery limitations

### 🚨 Issue 3: Overpromised Preset System
**Problem**: Extensive use of non-existent presets and templates throughout tutorials.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Clearly marked working vs. planned features with icons (✅ vs 🚧)
- ✅ Verified that `hypergen-starlight` preset system actually works
- ✅ Updated all preset examples to show current availability status
- ✅ Removed promises of thousands of templates, replaced with honest ecosystem status

### 🚨 Issue 4: Template Discovery Overpromises
**Problem**: Finding templates tutorial claimed thousands of templates available.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Updated to reflect only currently available template (`hypergen-starlight`)
- ✅ Marked all planned templates with 🚧 status
- ✅ Fixed npm search examples to show realistic results
- ✅ Set proper expectations about ecosystem growth

### 🚨 Issue 5: Workflow Continuity Problems
**Problem**: Tutorial flow would break when users tried examples.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Added realistic expectations in next-steps tutorial
- ✅ Acknowledged current limitations upfront
- ✅ Positioned users as potential early contributors
- ✅ Maintained encouraging tone while being honest about status
