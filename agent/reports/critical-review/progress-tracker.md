# Critical Documentation Review Progress Tracker

## IMPORTANT: ASPIRATIONAL DOCUMENTATION REVIEW

**This is a review of ASPIRATIONAL DOCUMENTATION** - we are evaluating the documented vision of how HyperDev WILL work, not comparing to current implementation. We ignore the current `hypergen` implementation completely and focus on the internal consistency and logical coherence of the documented vision.

## High Priority Files for Vision Review

Based on the Epic template parameter conceptual issue identified, these files are likely to contain vision design problems:

1. **tools/epics.mdx** - Primary Epic tool vision documentation 
2. **cli/commands/resources/epic.mdx** - Epic command vision documentation
3. **tools/overview.mdx** - Overall tool vision and conceptual framework
4. **methodology.mdx** - Core methodology and approach vision
5. **tools/dev.mdx** - Development workflow vision

## Known Vision Issues to Investigate

1. **Epic Template Parameter Logic Issue**: Templates like "saas-feature", "api-service" describe features, not document formats - conceptual mismatch in the design vision
2. **Terminology Consistency**: Check for consistent use of terms like "Epic", "Template", "Recipe", "Action" within the vision
3. **Workflow Logic**: Verify that documented workflows make logical sense within the envisioned system
4. **Parameter Design Logic**: Check that all parameters align with their intended purpose in the vision

## Review Focus Areas

### What to Review (Vision-focused):
- **Internal consistency** within the documented vision
- **Logical coherence** of the envisioned tool design  
- **User experience** clarity in the documented system
- **Conceptual clarity** and logical parameter design
- **Workflow completeness** within the envisioned system

### What to Ignore:
- Current `hypergen` implementation
- Whether commands currently exist
- Current package names or installation methods
- Any existing source code behavior
- Implementation status of features

## Instructions for Updating This File

When an agent completes a file review:

1. Update the file's status from "Pending" to "Completed"
2. Add the agent ID/name in the "Reviewer Agent" column
3. Add count of vision issues found in "Vision Issues Found" column
4. Update priority level (High/Medium/Low) based on vision issue severity
5. Update batch progress when all files in batch are complete
6. Update overall counts at the top
