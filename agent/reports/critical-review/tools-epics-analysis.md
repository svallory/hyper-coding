# Critical Review: tools/epics.mdx

## Document Overview
- **File**: /work/hyperdev/apps/docs/tools/epics.mdx
- **Purpose**: Defines the aspirational vision for the Epic tool - strategic planning, PRD management, architecture design, and task orchestration
- **Target Audience**: Development teams, product managers, and technical leads using the envisioned HyperDev Epic system

## Critical Issues Found

### High Priority Issues

#### 1. Fundamental Conceptual Confusion: What is an "Epic"?
- **Location**: Throughout document, but notably lines 49, 100, 331-354
- **Current Vision**: Document conflates two completely different concepts:
  1. "Epic" as a planning document (PRD, technical specs)
  2. "Epic" as a large development initiative (collection of tasks/stories)
- **Problem**: The vision treats these as the same thing, creating fundamental logical inconsistency
- **Impact**: Users would be completely confused about what the tool actually does
- **Suggested Fix**: Choose one definition and be consistent, or clearly separate "Epic Planning Documents" from "Epic Initiatives"

#### 2. Template Parameter Logic Flaw
- **Location**: Line 49 `--template=saas-product` and implied throughout subcommands
- **Current Vision**: Templates describe what you're building ("saas-product", "api-service") rather than document formats
- **Problem**: An Epic is a formal document (PRD). Templates should define document structure, not feature types
- **Impact**: High - this makes the entire template system nonsensical from a user perspective
- **Suggested Fix**: Templates should be document-oriented: "prd-format", "technical-spec", "architecture-doc", "agile-epic-format"

#### 3. Scope Confusion: Tool vs. Project Management Platform
- **Location**: Lines 32-37 (TUI Dashboard), 421-426 (Real-time Collaboration)
- **Current Vision**: Includes features like "Real-time Dashboard", "Team Collaboration", "Shared Planning Sessions"
- **Problem**: This is describing a full project management platform, not a code generation tool
- **Impact**: High - fundamentally misaligned with the tool's core purpose
- **Suggested Fix**: Focus on document generation and template management, not team collaboration platforms

### Medium Priority Issues

#### 4. Inconsistent Epic Structure Definition
- **Location**: Lines 111-134 (Epic Structure) vs 136-177 (Epic Configuration)
- **Current Vision**: Shows `.hyperdev/epics/` containing both PRD documents AND epic definitions
- **Problem**: Confuses whether epics are documents or project structures
- **Impact**: Users wouldn't know what files to create or where
- **Suggested Fix**: Clarify that epics generate documentation in a structured format, not manage project files

#### 5. AI Feature Integration Logic Gap
- **Location**: Lines 475-492 (AI-Powered Planning)
- **Current Vision**: AI features for "requirement analysis", "task generation", "risk analysis"
- **Problem**: These are project management features, not document/code generation features
- **Impact**: Medium - adds complexity that doesn't align with core tool purpose
- **Suggested Fix**: Focus AI on document generation assistance, template improvement, and content validation

#### 6. Integration Claims Without Clear Interface
- **Location**: Lines 430-448 (Integration with Other Tools)
- **Current Vision**: Claims integration with gen, dx, dev, dash tools
- **Problem**: No clear interface definition for how Epic documents would drive other tools
- **Impact**: Medium - users wouldn't understand how to use epics with other tools
- **Suggested Fix**: Define specific interfaces - what data formats epics produce that other tools consume

### Lower Priority Issues

#### 7. Terminology Inconsistency: "Epic" vs "PRD"
- **Location**: Throughout document
- **Current Vision**: Uses "Epic" and "PRD" interchangeably but they're different concepts
- **Problem**: PRDs are one type of document that could be part of an epic
- **Impact**: Low-Medium - creates terminology confusion
- **Suggested Fix**: Use consistent terminology - either focus on "Epic Planning Documents" or "PRD Generation"

#### 8. Workflow Complexity Overload
- **Location**: Lines 331-354 (Epic Decomposition Process)
- **Current Vision**: 4-phase decomposition process with 13 sub-steps
- **Problem**: Overly complex for a template-based document generation tool
- **Impact**: Low - would intimidate users with unnecessary complexity
- **Suggested Fix**: Simplify to template selection → content generation → validation

## Specific Examples

### Issue: Epic Template Logic Contradiction
- **Location**: Lines 45-55, init subcommand examples
- **Current Text**: `hyperdev epics init --template=saas-product`
- **Problem**: This suggests the template defines what kind of product you're building, but an Epic is a planning document. The template should define the document format, not the product type.
- **Impact**: Fundamental misunderstanding of what users are generating
- **Suggested Fix**: `hyperdev epics init --template=prd-standard` or `--template=technical-spec`

### Issue: Subcommand Purpose Confusion  
- **Location**: Lines 58-73, `arch` subcommand
- **Current Text**: "Architecture design and documentation tools" with diagram generation
- **Problem**: This describes an architecture design tool, not an epic generation tool
- **Impact**: Users would expect a completely different type of functionality
- **Suggested Fix**: Focus on generating architecture documentation templates, not designing architecture

### Issue: Configuration Example Mismatch
- **Location**: Lines 136-177, Epic Configuration YAML
- **Current Text**: Shows epic configuration with timeline, resources, risks
- **Problem**: This is project management data, not document generation configuration
- **Impact**: Users wouldn't understand what this configuration is for
- **Suggested Fix**: Show template variables and document generation parameters instead

## Overall Assessment
- **Vision Quality Score**: 4/10 - Fundamental conceptual confusion undermines the entire vision
- **User Impact**: High - Users would be completely confused about the tool's purpose and functionality
- **Priority for Vision Fixes**: High - Core conceptual issues must be resolved before implementation

## Recommendations

### 1. Clarify Core Concept (CRITICAL)
Choose whether "epics" tool:
- A) Generates epic planning documents (PRDs, tech specs, etc.) using templates
- B) Manages epic initiatives with tasks, timelines, and resources
These are different tools. Current vision tries to do both and fails at both.

### 2. Redesign Template System (CRITICAL)  
Templates should define document structure, not feature types:
- Document-oriented: `prd-template`, `technical-spec`, `architecture-doc`
- Not feature-oriented: `saas-product`, `api-service`

### 3. Scope Reduction (HIGH)
Remove project management features:
- TUI dashboards for team collaboration
- Real-time progress tracking  
- Resource allocation and timeline management
Focus on document generation with good templates.

### 4. Workflow Simplification (MEDIUM)
Simplify to core workflow:
1. Select document template type
2. Provide content parameters  
3. Generate structured document
4. Validate and refine

### 5. Integration Interface Definition (MEDIUM)
Define clear data interfaces:
- What structured data do epics produce?
- How do other tools consume epic outputs?
- What file formats enable integration?

The current vision conflates document generation with project management, creating fundamental confusion that would make the tool unusable. Focus the vision on one clear purpose: generating high-quality planning documents using templates and AI assistance.
