# Critical Review: migration-guide.mdx

## Document Overview
- **File**: /work/hyperdev/apps/docs/migration-guide.mdx
- **Purpose**: Provide comprehensive migration paths from existing code generation tools (Hygen, Yeoman, Plop, Custom Scripts) to HyperDev
- **Target Audience**: Developers and teams migrating from other code generation tools to HyperDev

## Critical Issues Found

### High Priority Issues

#### 1. Package Installation Inconsistency
- **Location**: Line 61
- **Current Text**: `npm install -g @hyperdev/hypergen`
- **Problem**: The document uses npm for installation despite the project using bun and the global CLAUDE.md instructions stating "YOU HATE NPM. Never use npm, only bun"
- **Impact**: Contradicts project standards and user preferences, creates confusion about the preferred package manager
- **Suggested Fix**: `bun install -g @hyperdev/hypergen` or `bun add --global @hyperdev/hypergen`

#### 2. Action System Conceptual Mismatch
- **Location**: Lines 143-178 (HyperDev Action example)
- **Current Text**: Shows TypeScript class-based actions with decorators (`@Action('generate-component')`)
- **Problem**: The V8 action system is documented as a recipe-based system elsewhere, but here it's shown as TypeScript classes with decorators. This creates fundamental confusion about what the V8 action system actually is
- **Impact**: High - Users will be confused about the actual architecture of HyperDev's action system
- **Suggested Fix**: Align with the recipe-based action system documentation or clarify the relationship between recipes and TypeScript actions

#### 3. Configuration System Inconsistencies
- **Location**: Lines 187-223 (hypergen.config.js example)
- **Current Text**: Shows extensive migration-specific configuration options
- **Problem**: This configuration structure doesn't align with the simplified configuration shown in other documentation. The migration options seem overly complex and don't match the core config system
- **Impact**: High - Creates confusion about HyperDev's actual configuration system
- **Suggested Fix**: Simplify to match the core configuration system documented elsewhere

### Medium Priority Issues

#### 1. Template Structure Inconsistency
- **Location**: Lines 100-122 (HyperDev template example)
- **Current Text**: Shows `files:` array in template.yml
- **Problem**: This doesn't match the template structure shown in other documentation where file operations are handled differently
- **Impact**: Medium - Users following this example may create invalid templates
- **Suggested Fix**: Align with the canonical template structure from other documentation

#### 2. Computed Values Feature Documentation Gap
- **Location**: Lines 357-361, 471-473
- **Current Text**: Shows `computed_values:` section in templates
- **Problem**: This feature is introduced without explanation or documentation of how it works, its syntax, or relationship to regular variables
- **Impact**: Medium - Users won't understand how to use this potentially powerful feature
- **Suggested Fix**: Add explanation of computed values or reference where they're documented

#### 3. Migration Command Inconsistency
- **Location**: Throughout migration commands
- **Current Text**: Various `hypergen migrate` commands with different subcommands
- **Problem**: The migration commands don't follow a consistent pattern and some seem redundant (e.g., `hypergen migrate templates` vs `hypergen migrate scripts`)
- **Impact**: Medium - Users may be confused about which commands to use
- **Suggested Fix**: Establish consistent migration command patterns

#### 4. Validation Command References
- **Location**: Lines 72, 247, 398, 613
- **Current Text**: Various `hypergen validate` commands
- **Problem**: The validation commands are referenced throughout but their actual capabilities and parameters aren't defined anywhere
- **Impact**: Medium - Users can't effectively use validation without knowing what options are available
- **Suggested Fix**: Either document validation commands or reference where they're documented

### Lower Priority Issues

#### 1. Card Component Usage Without Import
- **Location**: Lines 19-51, 564-604, 632-653
- **Current Text**: Uses `<Card>` and `<CardGroup>` components
- **Problem**: MDX components are used without imports, which may not work depending on the Mintlify setup
- **Impact**: Low - May cause rendering issues but doesn't affect conceptual understanding
- **Suggested Fix**: Verify these components are available globally in Mintlify or add imports

#### 2. Code Block Language Inconsistencies
- **Location**: Various code blocks
- **Current Text**: Some code blocks use `yaml` for non-YAML content, some use generic `bash`
- **Problem**: Language tags don't always match content, affecting syntax highlighting
- **Impact**: Low - Cosmetic issue that doesn't affect functionality
- **Suggested Fix**: Ensure language tags match content type

## Specific Examples

### Issue: Migration Configuration Complexity
- **Location**: Lines 187-223
- **Current Text**: 
  ```javascript
  export default {
    migration: {
      source: 'hygen',
      preserve_file_structure: true,
      upgrade_actions: true,
      action_mappings: {
        'add': 'generate_file',
        'inject': 'inject_into_file',
        'append': 'append_to_file'
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- **Problem**: This creates a complex migration-specific configuration that users need to maintain after migration, which contradicts the goal of a clean migration
- **Impact**: Users may think they need to keep migration settings permanently
- **Suggested Fix**: Make migration settings temporary or explain that they can be removed after migration

### Issue: Action System Architecture Confusion
- **Location**: Lines 143-178
- **Current Text**: TypeScript class with `@Action('generate-component')` decorator
- **Problem**: This implies a complex class-based action system, but recipes are documented as simpler YAML-based systems elsewhere
- **Impact**: High confusion about what HyperDev's action architecture actually looks like
- **Suggested Fix**: Either show recipe-based actions or explain the relationship between recipes and TypeScript actions

### Issue: Template Validation References
- **Location**: Lines 72, 247, 398
- **Current Text**: `hypergen validate ./templates --strict`
- **Problem**: Validation commands are used throughout without explaining what validation does or what the flags mean
- **Impact**: Users can't effectively validate their migrations
- **Suggested Fix**: Add a validation section explaining what gets validated and available options

## Overall Assessment
- **Vision Quality Score**: 6/10 - The vision of comprehensive migration support is good, but execution has significant inconsistencies
- **User Impact**: High - Users following this guide may create invalid configurations or misunderstand HyperDev's architecture
- **Priority for Vision Fixes**: High - This is a critical onboarding document that needs to accurately represent HyperDev's systems

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Required
1. **Fix package manager inconsistency** - Replace all npm usage with bun
2. **Align action system documentation** - Either show recipes or explain TypeScript action relationship
3. **Simplify configuration examples** - Remove complex migration-specific config that doesn't match core system
4. **Standardize template structure** - Ensure examples match canonical template format

### Content Architecture Improvements
1. **Add migration validation section** - Document what validation does and available options
2. **Explain computed values** - Either document this feature or remove the examples
3. **Create consistent command patterns** - Establish clear patterns for migration commands
4. **Add troubleshooting validation** - Ensure troubleshooting solutions actually work

### Documentation Strategy
1. **Cross-reference validation** - Ensure all examples work with the systems documented elsewhere
2. **Progressive disclosure** - Start with simple migrations, then show advanced features
3. **Real-world examples** - Test migration examples with actual legacy codebases
4. **Post-migration cleanup** - Explain what temporary settings can be removed after migration

The migration guide has good intentions and comprehensive coverage, but it needs significant alignment with the core HyperDev system documentation to avoid confusing users about the tool's actual architecture and capabilities.
