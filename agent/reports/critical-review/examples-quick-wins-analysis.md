# Critical Review: examples/quick-wins.mdx

## Document Overview
- **File**: `/work/hyperdev/apps/docs/examples/quick-wins.mdx`
- **Purpose**: Provide immediate-use templates for common development patterns (components, APIs, configs, database models, testing)
- **Target Audience**: Developers needing quick solutions for standard development tasks

## Critical Issues Found

### High Priority Issues

#### Issue: Command Invocation Inconsistency
- **Location**: All usage examples throughout the document
- **Current Text**: `bun run hypergen react-component` and similar commands
- **Problem**: The documentation shows `bun run hypergen <template>` as the command pattern, but this doesn't align with typical CLI tool usage patterns or other HyperDev documentation that suggests `hyperdev` as the CLI name
- **Impact**: High - Users will be confused about the actual command name and invocation pattern
- **Suggested Fix**: Establish consistent CLI naming throughout documentation (likely `hyperdev` based on project name) and use standard invocation pattern

#### Issue: Template Discovery Mechanism Unclear
- **Location**: All template examples show local template.yml files
- **Current Text**: Templates are shown as if they exist locally in user projects
- **Problem**: The examples don't clarify whether these are built-in templates, user-created templates, or templates from a registry. The mental model of where templates come from and how they're accessed is missing
- **Impact**: High - Users won't understand how to actually use these templates or where they come from
- **Suggested Fix**: Clarify template sourcing model - are these built-in templates, examples for creation, or templates from a registry?

#### Issue: Missing Context for Template Helpers
- **Location**: Line 209, 724-732 (h.inflection.* usage)
- **Current Text**: Uses `h.inflection.classify()`, `h.inflection.pluralize()` without setup explanation
- **Problem**: Template examples use helper functions that aren't explained until much later in the document, and even then the explanation doesn't cover how to access these helpers
- **Impact**: High - Users copying templates will encounter undefined helper functions
- **Suggested Fix**: Either explain helper availability upfront or show plain template versions first, then introduce helpers

### Medium Priority Issues

#### Issue: Inconsistent Variable Naming Patterns
- **Location**: Throughout templates (componentName vs resourceName vs modelName)
- **Problem**: Some templates use camelCase (componentName), others use different patterns, without establishing a consistent convention for variable naming
- **Impact**: Medium - Could lead to inconsistent user expectations and template patterns
- **Suggested Fix**: Establish and document consistent variable naming conventions

#### Issue: Complex Template Structure Without Learning Progression
- **Location**: Lines 36-175 (React Component example)
- **Current Text**: Jumps immediately into complex multi-file template with conditional logic
- **Problem**: The first example is quite complex with conditional rendering, multiple files, and advanced EJS syntax - no simple "Hello World" template to establish basic concepts
- **Impact**: Medium - Steep learning curve may overwhelm new users
- **Suggested Fix**: Start with a simpler single-file template example, then build up complexity

#### Issue: Template File Extension Inconsistency
- **Location**: Throughout document (.ejs.t vs .ts.ejs.t)
- **Current Text**: Shows `.ejs.t` for some files, `.tsx.ejs.t` for others
- **Problem**: The pattern for template file extensions isn't clearly explained - when to use just `.ejs.t` vs `.<target-extension>.ejs.t`
- **Impact**: Medium - Users won't understand how to name their template files correctly
- **Suggested Fix**: Explain the template file naming convention clearly

#### Issue: Missing Error Handling in Template Logic
- **Location**: All template examples
- **Current Text**: Templates assume all variables are valid and available
- **Problem**: No examples of error handling, validation, or fallback behavior in templates
- **Impact**: Medium - Templates may fail silently or with poor error messages
- **Suggested Fix**: Include examples of defensive template programming

### Lower Priority Issues

#### Issue: Inconsistent Code Block Language Tags
- **Location**: Lines 95, 143 (mixing tsx and ejs)
- **Current Text**: Some template code blocks use `tsx`, others use `ejs`
- **Problem**: Inconsistent syntax highlighting that may confuse readers about what type of file they're looking at
- **Impact**: Low - Primarily a presentation issue
- **Suggested Fix**: Use consistent language tags that reflect the template nature (e.g., always use `ejs` or create custom highlighting)

#### Issue: Missing Package.json Dependencies Explanation
- **Location**: Lines 776-860 (Package.json template)
- **Current Text**: Shows dependencies without explaining why they're chosen or alternatives
- **Problem**: Users may not understand why specific dependencies are included or how to modify them
- **Impact**: Low - Advanced users can figure this out, but explanation would be helpful
- **Suggested Fix**: Add brief comments or explanation for dependency choices

## Specific Examples

### Issue: Template Source Confusion
- **Location**: Template file paths throughout examples
- **Current Text**: "templates/Component.tsx.ejs.t"
- **Problem**: Implies users need to create a `templates/` directory structure, but doesn't explain where this fits in the HyperDev ecosystem
- **Impact**: Users won't know where to put template files or how HyperDev finds them
- **Suggested Fix**: Clarify the template organization and discovery model

### Issue: Frontmatter vs Variable Confusion
- **Location**: Lines 37-40, template frontmatter
- **Current Text**: Shows YAML frontmatter with `to:` directive containing template variables
- **Problem**: The relationship between template.yml variables and template file frontmatter isn't clearly explained
- **Impact**: Users may not understand how variables flow from configuration to template execution
- **Suggested Fix**: Add explicit explanation of variable scope and usage

### Issue: Advanced Features Without Foundation
- **Location**: Lines 633-635 (Prisma injection example)
- **Current Text**: Shows template injection with `inject: true` and `after:` directives
- **Problem**: Introduces advanced template features without explaining the basics of template execution
- **Impact**: Users won't understand when/why to use injection vs regular file generation
- **Suggested Fix**: Either move advanced features to a separate section or provide foundational explanation first

## Overall Assessment
- **Vision Quality Score**: 7/10 - Good practical examples but missing foundational explanations and consistency
- **User Impact**: High - These are "quick wins" that users will try first, so clarity issues will immediately frustrate new users
- **Priority for Vision Fixes**: High - This is likely the first detailed documentation users will encounter

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Needed
1. **Establish CLI Command Consistency** - Standardize on `hyperdev` or whatever the actual CLI name will be
2. **Clarify Template Sourcing Model** - Explain whether these are built-in templates, user examples, or registry templates
3. **Add Progressive Learning Path** - Start with simple single-file template, build to complex multi-file examples
4. **Explain Template Helpers Early** - Document how helper functions are available and used

### Structural Improvements
1. **Add "How Templates Work" Section** - Before jumping into examples, explain the basic mental model
2. **Separate Basic vs Advanced Examples** - Don't mix injection and complex logic with basic generation
3. **Standardize Template Patterns** - Consistent variable naming, file organization, and code structure
4. **Add Template Debugging Section** - How to troubleshoot when templates don't work as expected

### Content Enhancements
1. **Include Template Validation Examples** - Show how to validate inputs and handle errors
2. **Add Template Testing Guidance** - How to verify templates work correctly
3. **Show Template Composition** - How templates can build on or reference each other
4. **Document Template Performance** - Best practices for efficient template execution

The documentation has strong practical value but needs foundational clarity and consistency improvements to serve as effective "quick wins" for new users.
