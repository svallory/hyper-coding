## Technical Architecture

### Binary Distribution Strategy

```
npm package (hyper-dash)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json          # npm configuration and metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ install.js            # Platform detection and binary download
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uninstall.js          # Cleanup and removal
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hyper-dash        # Node.js wrapper script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # Documentation

Installation Flow:
1. npm install triggers postinstall hook
2. install.js detects platform and architecture
3. Downloads appropriate binary from GitHub releases
4. Extracts and places binary as hyper-dash-bin
5. Wrapper script (hyper-dash) proxies to binary
6. Binary is available via npm bin or globally
```

### Platform Detection

- **macOS**: `darwin` with `x64`/`arm64` support
- **Linux**: `linux` with `x64`/`arm64` support  
- **Windows**: `win32` with `x64` support (ARM64 excluded per GoReleaser config)

### Download URL Strategy

Primary URL format:
```
https://github.com/hyperdev-io/hyper-dash/releases/download/v{version}/hyper-dash_{Platform}_{Arch}.{ext}
```

Fallback strategies:
1. Try without 'v' prefix in version
2. Try 'latest' release if version-specific fails
3. Comprehensive error reporting

### File Naming Convention

Matches GoReleaser output:
- **macOS**: `hyper-dash_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz`, `hyper-dash_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz`
- **Linux**: `hyper-dash_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz`, `hyper-dash_Linux_arm64.tar.gz`
- **Windows**: `hyper-dash_Windows_x86_64.zip`

## Integration with Existing CI/CD

### GoReleaser Compatibility

The npm package seamlessly integrates with the existing GoReleaser configuration:

- Uses identical binary naming convention
- Matches platform and architecture mappings  
- Downloads from GitHub releases created by CI/CD
- Supports same platforms as GoReleaser builds

### Version Synchronization

npm install -g hyper-dash
hyper-dash                    # Start dashboard
hyper-dash -test              # Test functionality
hyper-dash --version          # Show version
```

### Local Project Installation

```bash
npm install hyper-dash
npx hyper-dash                # Run via npx
