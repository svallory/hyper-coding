## Technical Accuracy Verification

### üö® CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### 1. Non-Existent NPM Packages Referenced
**Severity:** Critical - Will cause user frustration

**Issues:**
- Multiple references to `hypergen-starlight` package that doesn't exist on npm
- References to `hypergen-react-component`, `hypergen-express-api` etc. that don't exist
- Examples like `hypergen starlight --preset=full-featured` will fail

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ npm search hypergen-starlight
# Returns only @astrojs/starlight packages, not hypergen-specific ones
```

**Impact:** Users following tutorials will encounter "Template not found" errors immediately.

#### 2. Preset System Not Implemented
**Severity:** Critical - Core feature referenced doesn't exist

**Issues:**
- Extensive preset examples (`--preset=minimal`, `--preset=full-featured`) 
- Preset system appears to be aspirational, not implemented
- Template.yml files in codebase don't show preset configuration

**Evidence:**
- Checked `/test/fixtures/template-examples/_templates/starlight/new/template.yml`
- No preset definitions found, only individual variables
- Command `hypergen starlight --list-presets` would likely fail

#### 3. Command Syntax Issues
**Severity:** High - Examples won't work as written

**Issues:**
- Uses `hypergen` command but current project uses `bun run hygen`
- Discovery commands reference features that may not exist
- CLI syntax assumes published global package

**Testing Results:**
```bash
$ hypergen discover
# Command not found

$ bun run hygen discover  
# Works but finds 0 generators
```

### ‚úÖ POSITIVE TECHNICAL ASPECTS

#### 1. Correct Template Structure
- Proper `_templates/generator/action/` directory structure
- Correct `.ejs.t` file naming conventions
- Valid frontmatter YAML format examples

#### 2. Accurate EJS Templating
- Correct EJS syntax: `<%= variable %>`, `<% if %>`, etc.
- Valid template logic and parameter usage
- Good examples of conditional generation

#### 3. Valid Node.js/npm Concepts
- Correct npm installation commands
- Valid package.json structure examples  
- Accurate Node.js version requirements (18+)

# ‚ùå These will fail:
hypergen starlight --preset=full-featured --projectFolder=my-docs
hypergen react-component --name=Button --typescript=true
hypergen express-api --name=my-api --auth=jwt
```

**Recommended fixes:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Use actual working examples:
# Copy from test fixtures to _templates/
cp -r /test/fixtures/template-examples/_templates/starlight _templates/
hypergen starlight new --projectName="My Docs" --projectDescription="Documentation"

# Or use the existing react-component template:
hypergen react-component new --name=Button
```
