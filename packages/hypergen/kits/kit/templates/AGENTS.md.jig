# Project Context for AI Agents

This project is a Hypergen Kit. It contains recipes, actions, and templates to scaffold and manage projects.

## Structure

- **cookbooks/**: Contains recipes. The default recipe is usually in `cookbooks/create`.
- **actions/**: Custom actions written in TypeScript.
- **reference/**: Place reference code here for AI agents to analyze.
- **sandbox/**: A sandbox environment to test your kit.
- **tests/**: Automated tests.

## Conventions

- Recipes are written in YAML.
- Templates use Jig (Edge.js fork).
- Actions are TypeScript files defaulting to `index.ts` in their folder.
