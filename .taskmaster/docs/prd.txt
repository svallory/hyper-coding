# Hypergen V8 Documentation System - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Hypergen Documentation System V8
**Version**: 8.0.0
**Project Type**: Documentation Infrastructure
**Priority**: High
**Target Release**: Q1 2025

## Executive Summary

Hypergen currently has a significant documentation gap where only ~20% of implemented features are properly documented, while some documentation describes non-existent "V8 future features." This project will create a comprehensive, user-centered documentation system that accurately reflects Hypergen's impressive feature set and serves all stakeholder needs.

**Key Problem**: Users cannot effectively use Hypergen because:
- Core features like npm package templates are barely documented
- Getting started guides use non-functional examples
- Documentation shows V8 features that don't exist yet
- No clear learning paths for different user types

**Solution**: Create a complete 90+ page documentation system organized by user journey with accurate, tested examples.

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
1. **New Users** - Developers trying Hypergen for the first time
2. **Template Creators** - Developers building reusable templates
3. **Template Consumers** - Developers using existing templates
4. **Team Leads** - Managing enterprise template usage
5. **Contributors** - Extending and contributing to Hypergen

### User Journeys
- **Discovery Journey**: Learn about → Install → First success
- **Creation Journey**: Learn syntax → Build template → Test → Share
- **Consumption Journey**: Find template → Understand options → Customize → Generate
- **Enterprise Journey**: Evaluate → Implement → Govern → Scale
- **Contribution Journey**: Understand → Extend → Contribute → Maintain

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Documentation Issues
- **docs/ folder**: Astro-based site with incomplete content (8 pages exist)
- **docs-backup/ folder**: More complete but outdated markdown files
- **CLI Examples**: Most examples show incorrect usage patterns
- **Missing Documentation**: npm templates, presets, trust system, GitHub integration
- **Misleading Content**: V8 decorator syntax that doesn't work

### Working Features Not Documented
- npm Package Template System (global caching, version management)
- Preset System (pre-configured template variables)
- Trust System (security for external templates)  
- GitHub Integration (full repo template support)
- Advanced CLI (18+ commands with rich functionality)
- Performance System (multi-level caching, optimization)
