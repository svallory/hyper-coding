# v8-launch Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Hypergen has a powerful V8 foundation with advanced features (decorators, composition, plugins) but lacks completion in key areas: enhanced template.yml configuration, comprehensive CLI commands, file-based routing, and developer tooling.

**Solution**: Complete the V8 foundation by enhancing existing systems rather than rebuilding, focusing on the template.yml configuration system, CLI completion, and developer experience improvements.

**Value**: Establish Hypergen as the definitive modern code generation tool with superior developer experience and comprehensive feature set.

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements

**Core Features:**

1. **Enhanced Template.yml System** - Rich variable types, validation, composition, lifecycle hooks building on existing parser
2. **Complete CLI Commands** - Implement all planned commands (template validate, list, url resolve, system status)  
3. **File-based Routing** - Automatic path generation based on file structure with dynamic interpolation
4. **Developer Tools** - Template validation, linting, preview modes for better authoring experience
5. **Migration Tools** - Convert frontmatter to template.yml, assist with upgrades
6. **Performance Optimizations** - Enhanced caching, parallel processing improvements

**User Workflows:**

1. **Template Development** - Create, validate, test, and iterate on templates with rich tooling
2. **Generator Discovery** - Find, install, and manage generators from multiple sources  
3. **Code Generation** - Execute generators with rich parameter validation and error handling

### Technical Requirements

**Performance**: Maintain <100ms startup time, handle 1000+ generators without degradation
**Security**: Secure template execution, validation of remote templates
**Scalability**: Efficient memory usage, parallel processing support
**Integration**: Seamless integration with existing V8 systems

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Usability**: Clear error messages, comprehensive help system, intuitive workflows
**Reliability**: 99%+ test coverage, comprehensive error handling
**Maintainability**: Clear code structure, comprehensive documentation
**Compatibility**: Backward compatible with existing templates during transition

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Architecture

**Components:**
- Enhanced `TemplateParser` with rich variable system
- Complete `CLI` command implementation
- New `FileBasedRouting` system
- Enhanced `DeveloperTools` for template authoring
- `MigrationTools` for format conversion

**Data Model:**
- Extended `TemplateConfig` interface with composition and lifecycle
- Rich `VariableDefinition` types with validation
- Enhanced `ActionMetadata` for better CLI integration

### Development Phases

**Phase 1 - Enhanced Configuration (Weeks 1-2)**
- Enhance existing template.yml parser with rich variable types
- Add composition and lifecycle support
- Implement comprehensive validation system

**Phase 2 - CLI Completion (Weeks 2-3)**
- Implement template validation commands
- Add system status and URL resolution commands
- Enhance help system and error messages

**Phase 3 - Developer Experience (Weeks 3-4)**
- File-based routing implementation
- Template development tools (preview, linting)
- Migration utilities

**Phase 4 - Polish & Documentation (Weeks 4-5)**
- Performance optimizations
- Comprehensive documentation
- Testing completion

### Dependencies & Risks

**Technical Dependencies:**
- Existing V8 architecture (actions, plugins, storage)
- Current template.yml parser foundation
- Hash-indexed storage system

**Risks & Mitigation:**
- Breaking changes: Comprehensive backward compatibility testing
- Feature creep: Strict scope adherence to enhancement vs. rebuild
- Performance regression: Continuous benchmarking

## Success Criteria

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- All planned CLI commands functional with comprehensive help
- Template.yml supports rich variable types with validation
- File-based routing eliminates need for manual `to:` specification
- Migration path available from frontmatter to template.yml
- Performance maintained or improved
- 99%+ test coverage for new features

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Developer can create complex generators 5x faster with new tooling
- All roadmap Phase 1-3 features implemented
- Comprehensive documentation covers all features
- Migration tools successfully convert existing templates

## Implementation Notes

### For Task Generation

**Recommended Task Categories:**
1. **Configuration Enhancement**: Template.yml parser improvements
2. **CLI Implementation**: Complete command structure
3. **Routing System**: File-based path generation
4. **Developer Tools**: Validation, preview, linting tools
5. **Migration Utilities**: Format conversion tools
6. **Testing & Documentation**: Comprehensive coverage and docs

### Technical Guidance

- Leverage existing `src/config/template-parser.ts` as foundation
- Build on current CLI structure in `src/cli/cli.ts`
- Utilize existing hash-indexed storage for performance
- Integrate with current plugin architecture
- Follow established TypeScript patterns and testing strategies

### Critical Success Factors

- Enhance rather than rebuild existing systems
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Focus on developer experience improvements
- Ensure comprehensive testing of all enhancements
- Document all new capabilities thoroughly
