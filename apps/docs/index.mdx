# HyperDev: Controlled AI Development Acceleration

**HyperDev** is a comprehensive development acceleration toolkit that transforms AI from an unpredictable assistant into a controlled, quality-assured development accelerator. Unlike "Vibe Coding" where developers hope for the best, HyperDev implements **Hyper Coding** - a systematic approach with built-in quality controls, security validation, and architectural compliance at every step.

## The HyperDev Workflow

HyperDev provides four integrated tools that form a complete development workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Project Kickstart" icon="rocket">
    **gen** - AI-augmented template-based code generation with trust systems and composition frameworks
  </Step>
  <Step title="Planning" icon="map">
    **epics** - Product requirement management, architecture design, and strategic task planning with TUI dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execution" icon="play">
    **dev** - Real-time AI assistant monitoring and control with quality gates and validation checkpoints
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitoring" icon="chart-bar">
    **dash** - Performance monitoring, quality metrics, and team collaboration dashboard
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why HyperDev?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="The Problem">
    <Warning>
      **Current AI Coding Is Dangerous**
    </Warning>
    
    - **40-45% of AI-generated code** contains exploitable security vulnerabilities
    - Context drift leads to architectural violations and scope creep  
    - Technical debt accumulates rapidly without quality controls
    - No systematic approach to validating AI output
    - Developers are essentially "hoping for the best" (Vibe Coding)
