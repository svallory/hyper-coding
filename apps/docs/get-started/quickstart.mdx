# HyperDev Quickstart

> Go from zero to fully controlled AI development in under 10 minutes

This quickstart guide walks you through the complete HyperDev workflow - from installation to your first AI-generated, quality-controlled project. You'll experience the full power of **Hyper Coding** methodology with built-in security validation and architectural compliance.

<Info>
  **New to HyperDev?** This guide assumes you've already [installed HyperDev](/installation). If not, complete the installation first.

## Your First HyperDev Project

Let's create a production-ready full-stack application using HyperDev's controlled AI generation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Workspace">
    Initialize a new HyperDev workspace with strategic planning:
    
    ```bash
    hyper gen workspace my-awesome-app
    cd my-awesome-app
    ```
    
    This creates a workspace with:
    - Quality gate configurations
    - Security validation rules  
    - Template trust policies
    - Development environment settings
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Strategic Planning with epics">
    Define your project requirements using AI-assisted planning:
    
    ```bash
    hyper epics init --type "full-stack-saas"
    hyper epics generate-prd --interactive
    ```
    
    <Tip>
      epics creates comprehensive PRDs with AI assistance while maintaining human oversight for strategic decisions.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate Your Project">
    Use controlled AI generation to create your codebase:
    
    ```bash
    hyper gen scaffold --template react-node-saas --trust-level verified
    ```
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/generation-progress.png" alt="HyperDev Generation Progress" />
    </Frame>
    
    The generation process includes:
    - Template security validation
    - Architectural compliance checking
    - Dependency vulnerability scanning
    - Code quality assessment
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Development Setup">
    Configure your development environment for the HyperDev workflow:
    
    ```bash
    hyper dev init --quality-gates strict --hooks enabled
    ```
    
    This configures:
    - Development monitoring setup
    - Quality gate automation
    - Security validation triggers
    - AI assistance integration
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Experiencing the Complete Workflow

Now let's see HyperDev's methodology in action by implementing a new feature:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="1. Planning Phase">
    Start with strategic feature planning:
    
    ```bash
    hyper epics add-feature "User Authentication System"
    ```
    
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Generated Requirements" icon="document">
        epics generates comprehensive requirements including:
        - Security specifications (OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens)
        - Architecture patterns (repository pattern, middleware)
        - Test strategies (unit, integration, e2e)
        - Performance requirements (response times, scalability)
      </Accordion>
      
      <Accordion title="Risk Analysis" icon="shield">
        Automatic identification of:
        - Security vulnerabilities to prevent
        - Performance bottlenecks to avoid
        - Architectural anti-patterns to skip
        - Compliance requirements to meet
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="2. Generation Phase">
    Generate the feature with controlled AI:
    
    ```bash
    hyper gen feature auth-system --epic-id auth-001 --validate-security
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      All generated code goes through automatic security validation. HyperDev prevents the 40-45% of AI-generated vulnerabilities before they reach your codebase.
    </Warning>
    
    Generated components include:
    - Authentication middleware with security best practices
    - Database models with proper validation
    - API endpoints with rate limiting
    - Frontend components with XSS protection
    - Comprehensive test suites
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="3. Development Phase">
    Monitor AI development with quality controls:
    
    ```bash
    hyper dev watch --quality-gates enabled
    ```
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/dev-monitoring.png" alt="HyperDev Development Monitoring" />
    </Frame>
    
    Real-time monitoring includes:
    - Code quality metrics
    - Security vulnerability scanning
    - Performance impact analysis
    - Architectural compliance checking
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="4. Validation Phase">
    Comprehensive quality assurance:
    
    ```bash
    hyper dev validate --full-suite
    ```
