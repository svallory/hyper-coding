# HyperDev Tools: A Cohesive Development Workflow

HyperDev provides five integrated tools that form a complete development acceleration workflow. Each tool implements **Hyper Coding** principles with built-in quality controls, security validation, and architectural compliance.

## The Complete Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Project Kickstart" icon="rocket">
    **gen** - AI-augmented template-based code generation
    - Intelligent template discovery and composition
    - Trust system for external templates
    - Multi-source template aggregation
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Setup Customization" icon="settings">
    **dx** - Developer experience optimization
    - IDE integration and configuration
    - Claude Code hooks and workflow automation
    - Development environment standardization
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Strategic Planning" icon="map">
    **epics** - Product requirements and architecture design
    - PRD management and validation
    - Architecture documentation and design reviews
    - Task orchestration with dependency management
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Execution Control" icon="play">
    **dev** - Real-time AI assistant monitoring
    - Quality gates and validation checkpoints
    - Context engineering and prompt optimization
    - Continuous verification loops
  </Step>
  <Step title="5. Monitoring & Collaboration" icon="chart-bar">
    **dash** - Performance monitoring and team coordination
    - Quality metrics and security dashboards
    - Team collaboration and progress tracking
    - Production monitoring and alerting
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tool Integration Matrix

Each tool seamlessly integrates with others in the workflow:

| Tool | Primary Function | Integrates With | Key Outputs |
|------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **gen** | Code Generation | dx, epics, dev | Generated codebase, templates |
| **dx** | Environment Setup | gen, dev, dash | IDE configs, hooks, workflows |
| **epics** | Strategic Planning | gen, dev, dash | PRDs, architecture docs, tasks |
| **dev** | Execution Control | gen, dx, epics | Validated code, quality reports |
| **dash** | Monitoring | dx, epics, dev | Metrics, alerts, team insights |

## Quality Controls by Tool

- **Alert Management**: Proactive issue detection and notification

## Tool-Specific Subcommands

### gen (Code Generation)
```bash
hyperdev gen <template>      # Generate code from template
hyperdev gen search <query>  # Find templates matching criteria
hyperdev gen list           # List available templates
hyperdev gen pack <name>    # Package templates for distribution
hyperdev gen validate       # Validate template structure
```

### dx (Developer Experience)
```bash
hyperdev dx init            # Initialize development environment
hyperdev dx hooks          # Setup Claude Code hooks
hyperdev dx config         # Configure IDE integrations
hyperdev dx validate       # Verify environment setup
```

### epics (Strategic Planning)
```bash
hyperdev epics init        # Initialize epic planning
hyperdev epics arch        # Architecture design tools
hyperdev epics tasks       # Task management interface
hyperdev epics dash        # Strategic dashboard view
```

### dev (Execution Control)
```bash
hyperdev dev watch         # Monitor AI development session
hyperdev dev validate      # Run quality gate checks
hyperdev dev context       # Manage AI context
hyperdev dev report        # Generate development reports
```

### dash (Monitoring & Collaboration)
```bash
hyperdev dash start        # Launch monitoring dashboard
hyperdev dash metrics      # View quality and performance metrics
hyperdev dash alerts       # Manage alert configurations
hyperdev dash team         # Team collaboration interface
```

## Implementation Architecture

### Shared Infrastructure
All tools share common infrastructure for consistency:
- **Configuration Management**: Unified settings across tools
- **Security Framework**: Consistent security validation
- **Quality Gates**: Shared validation pipelines
- **Monitoring Integration**: Centralized metrics and logging

### Tool-Specific Specialization
Each tool provides specialized functionality:
