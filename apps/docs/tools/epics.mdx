```

## Epic Template System

### Understanding Epic Templates

Epic templates define **document formats** and **planning structures**, not what you're building. Templates specify how to organize and present information, not the specific features or products you're developing.

#### Correct Template Usage (Document Formats)
```bash
# Document structure templates
hyper epics init --template=technical-prd      # Technical PRD format
hyper epics init --template=business-prd       # Business-focused PRD format
hyper epics init --template=feature-spec       # Feature specification format
hyper epics init --template=architecture-doc   # Architecture documentation format
hyper epics init --template=minimal-epic       # Lightweight epic format
```

#### Incorrect Template Usage (Feature Types)
```bash
# ❌ Wrong - These describe WHAT you're building, not HOW to document it
hyper epics init --template=saas-product
hyper epics init --template=e-commerce-app  
hyper epics init --template=mobile-app
hyper epics init --template=api-service
```

### Available Epic Templates

<Accordion title="Document Format Templates">
| Template | Description | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `technical-prd` | Comprehensive PRD with technical details | Complex features requiring technical depth |
| `business-prd` | Business-focused PRD format | Business stakeholder communication |
| `feature-spec` | Lightweight feature specification | Small to medium features |
| `architecture-doc` | System architecture documentation | Technical planning and system design |
| `minimal-epic` | Basic epic structure | Simple features or proof of concepts |
| `enterprise-prd` | Enterprise-grade PRD with compliance | Regulated industries and large organizations |
</Accordion>

<Note>
**Key Concept**: Epic templates are about **HOW** you plan and document, not **WHAT** you're planning to build. The content (your SaaS product, mobile app, etc.) comes from your specific requirements, while the template provides the structure for organizing that information.
</Note>

### Technical Decision Records (ADR)
```markdown
# ADR-001: Authentication Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to implement user authentication for our SaaS platform with requirements for:
- Scalability to handle 100k+ users
- Integration with multiple client applications
- Strong security with modern best practices
- Compliance with GDPR and SOC2

## Decision
We will implement JWT-based authentication with:
- Access tokens (15-minute expiry)
- Refresh tokens (30-day expiry)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- OAuth2 integration for third-party providers

## Consequences
### Positive
- Stateless authentication scales horizontally
- Industry-standard approach with good library support
- Flexible authorization model
- Strong security with token rotation

### Negative
- Token management complexity
- Requires secure refresh token storage
- Additional infrastructure for token validation

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up JWT library and token generation
2. Implement refresh token rotation
3. Create RBAC policy engine
4. Add OAuth2 provider integration
5. Implement security monitoring
```
