4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor progress against defined objectives
5. **Quality Focus**: Prioritize quality over generation speed

### Quality Gate Configuration
1. **Appropriate Thresholds**: Set realistic but high-quality thresholds
2. **Fast Feedback**: Configure gates for immediate feedback
3. **Clear Actions**: Define clear actions for gate failures
4. **Regular Tuning**: Adjust thresholds based on experience
5. **Team Alignment**: Ensure team understands quality standards

### Context Engineering
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include all relevant context areas
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep context current with project evolution
3. **Validation**: Regularly validate context accuracy and completeness
4. **Optimization**: Optimize context for AI processing efficiency
5. **Team Sharing**: Share context insights across team members

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Context Drift**: Regular context validation and updates
2. **Quality Gate Failures**: Review and adjust validation thresholds
