# User Workflows & Experience Design

This document maps the complete user journey through HyperDev, from initial installation to advanced template creation and team collaboration. Each workflow is designed around user success metrics and optimal developer experience.

## Design Principles

Our user experience is built on these core principles:

### 1. **15-Minute Success Goal**
Every new user should achieve their first successful code generation within 15 minutes of installation.

### 2. **Progressive Disclosure**
Start simple, reveal complexity gradually as users need it. No overwhelming first experiences.

### 3. **Self-Service Excellence**
Users should find answers and solve problems independently through intuitive design and clear guidance.

### 4. **Zero-Friction Defaults**
Smart defaults that work for 80% of use cases, with easy customization for the remaining 20%.

### 5. **Contextual Intelligence**
The system should understand user context and provide relevant suggestions and shortcuts.

## Core User Personas

### **Sarah - Frontend Developer**
- **Goal**: Generate React components quickly
- **Pain**: Repetitive boilerplate, inconsistent patterns
- **Success Metric**: Creates 3+ components in 10 minutes

### **Marcus - Full-Stack Engineer**
- **Goal**: Scaffold complete features (API + UI)
- **Pain**: Context switching between technologies
- **Success Metric**: Full-stack feature in 20 minutes

### **Lisa - Team Lead**
- **Goal**: Standardize team patterns and enforce consistency
- **Pain**: Code review overhead, pattern drift
- **Success Metric**: Team uses standardized templates 90% of time

### **David - DevOps Engineer**
- **Goal**: Generate infrastructure and configuration files
- **Pain**: Template maintenance across environments
- **Success Metric**: Deploys consistent configs in minutes

## Workflow 1: First-Time User Journey

**Target Time**: 15 minutes from install to first generation

### Phase 1: Installation (2 minutes)
```bash
# One-command installation
npm install -g hyperdev
# or
brew install hyperdev
```

**UX Elements**:
- Installation progress indicator
- Automatic environment detection
- Post-install success confirmation with next steps

### Phase 2: Environment Setup (3 minutes)
```bash
# Auto-detects project type and suggests templates
hyper init
```

**User Experience Flow**:
1. **Project Detection**: Automatically scans current directory
2. **Smart Suggestions**: "I see you're in a React project. Want to add component templates?"
3. **Interactive Setup**: Visual wizard with sensible defaults
4. **Validation**: Confirms setup with green checkmarks

**Visual Feedback**:
```
✓ Detected React + TypeScript project
✓ Added component templates
✓ Configured with your existing patterns
→ Ready to generate! Try: hyper gen component MyButton
```

### Phase 3: First Generation (5 minutes)
```bash
# Interactive template selection
hyper generate
# or direct generation
hyper gen component UserCard
```

**UX Journey**:
1. **Template Gallery**: Visual preview of available templates
2. **Interactive Prompts**: Smart defaults based on project context
3. **Live Preview**: Shows what will be generated before confirmation
4. **Success Celebration**: Clear indication of what was created

**Success Metrics**:
- User generates first component successfully
- Files appear in expected locations
- Code compiles/runs immediately
- User understands the pattern
