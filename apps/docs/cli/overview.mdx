# HyperDev CLI Overview

The HyperDev CLI is your unified command-line interface for AI-augmented development, providing a single `hyper` command that orchestrates the entire [HyperDev methodology](/methodology) through intuitive subcommands.

## Design Philosophy

### Progressive Disclosure
The CLI is designed so you don't need to learn everything at once:
- **Beginners**: Start with simple workflow commands like `hyper init` and `hyper gen`
- **Intermediate**: Discover resources with `hyper search` and `hyper list`
- **Advanced**: Access full tool power with `hyper gen`, `hyper epics`, etc.

### Intuitive Discovery
Commands follow natural language patterns and guide you to what you need:
```bash
hyper init              # Start a new project
hyper gen               # Generate code from templates
hyper plan              # Strategic planning and architecture
hyper dev               # Monitor AI-assisted development
hyper dash              # Launch interactive dashboard
```

## Command Categories

### üöÄ Workflow Commands
Primary commands that follow your development workflow:
- [`hyper init`](/cli/commands/workflow/init) - Initialize new projects with optimal setup
- [`hyper gen`](/cli/commands/workflow/gen) - AI-augmented code generation
- [`hyper plan`](/cli/commands/workflow/plan) - Strategic planning and architecture design
- [`hyper dev`](/cli/commands/workflow/dev) - Real-time development monitoring

### üîç Discovery Commands
Find exactly what you need across the HyperDev ecosystem:
- [`hyper search`](/cli/commands/discovery/search) - Universal search for templates, patterns, solutions
- [`hyper list`](/cli/commands/discovery/list) - List available resources with filtering
- [`hyper status`](/cli/commands/discovery/status) - Project health and progress overview

### üìã Resource Commands
Manage project resources and components:
- [`hyper plan`](/cli/commands/resources/plan) - Epic planning and management
- [`hyper task`](/cli/commands/resources/task) - Task creation and tracking
- [`hyper docs`](/cli/commands/resources/docs) - Project documentation management

### üìä Dashboard
Interactive monitoring and control:
- [`hyper dash`](/cli/commands/dash) - Launch TUI dashboard for comprehensive project monitoring

### üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Tool Access
Direct access to the five core HyperDev tools for power users:
- [`hyper gen`](/cli/commands/tools/gen) - Advanced code generation features  
- [`hyper epics`](/cli/commands/tools/epics) - Advanced strategic planning tools
- [`hyper dev`](/cli/commands/tools/dev) - Advanced development monitoring
- [`hyper config`](/cli/commands/tools/dx) - Developer experience optimization
- [`hyper dash`](/cli/commands/tools/dash) - Advanced monitoring and analytics

## Key Features

### Smart Defaults
Every command works with sensible defaults that suit most use cases:
```bash
hyper init                    # Sets up project with intelligent defaults
hyper gen react-app     # Uses best practices for React applications
hyper plan                   # Creates standard epic structure
```

### Contextual Help
Get help exactly when and where you need it:
```bash
hyper --help                 # Overview of all commands
hyper gen --help        # Detailed help for generate command
hyper help workflows         # Workflow guidance and best practices
```

### Composable Commands
Commands work together naturally in scripts and workflows:
```bash
# Complete project setup flow
hyper init fullstack-saas
hyper gen api-gateway --context "user management"
hyper plan create --name "Authentication System"
hyper dev --watch --focus auth
```

## Integration with HyperDev Methodology

The CLI directly implements the [HyperDev methodology](/methodology), providing command-line access to:

- **[Gen Tool](/tools/gen)** - AI-augmented code generation with trust systems
- **[Epics Tool](/tools/epics)** - Strategic planning and architecture design  
- **[Dev Tool](/tools/dev)** - Real-time AI monitoring and quality gates
- **[DX Tool](/tools/dx)** - Developer experience optimization
- **[Dash Tool](/tools/dash)** - Performance monitoring and team analytics

<Info>
  The CLI provides a command-line focused view of the same tools documented in the [Tools](/tools/overview) section. 
  Use the tools documentation to understand concepts, and the CLI documentation to learn command syntax and workflows.
</Info>

## Error Handling & Guidance

The CLI provides intelligent error messages with suggested solutions:

```bash
$ hyper gen api-template
Error: No templates found matching "api-template"

Did you mean:
  - express-api-template (trust: 9.2) 
  - fastapi-template (trust: 8.8)
  - nestjs-api-template (trust: 9.5)

Try:
  hyper search "api template" --type templates
  hyper gen express-api-template
  hyper list templates --filter api

Need help? Run: hyper help templates
```
