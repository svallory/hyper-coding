## RecipeTool class

Recipe Tool for processing recipe composition in the Recipe Step System

This tool implements the core insight that composition is simpler than inheritance. Instead of complex configuration merging and template inheritance, recipes are executed as orchestrated steps that can call other recipes with clear variable passing patterns.

Features: - Multiple recipe source discovery (local files, URLs, npm packages) - Variable inheritance with clear override patterns - Sub-recipe execution with proper context management - Result aggregation from child recipes - Error handling and rollback for failed sub-recipes - Circular dependency detection with clear error messages - Recipe caching for performance optimization - Variable mapping and transformation support

```typescript
export declare class RecipeTool extends Tool<RecipeStep>
