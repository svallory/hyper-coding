# dev: Development Monitoring & Control

The **dev** tool helps you monitor and control your AI-assisted development sessions. It ensures your AI interactions stay focused, secure, and produce high-quality code.

## Quick Start

Monitor your development session in real-time:

```bash
# Start monitoring your current session
hyper dev watch

# Monitor with focus on specific files
hyper dev watch --focus src/components
```

## Core Concept: AI Development Control

When working with AI assistants, the **dev** tool provides:

- **Session Monitoring**: See what your AI is doing in real-time
- **Quality Checks**: Automatic validation of generated code
- **Focus Control**: Keep AI focused on your objectives

### Basic Development Flow

1. **Start monitoring**: `hyper dev watch`
2. **Work with AI**: Generate code as usual
3. **Review results**: See quality reports and suggestions
4. **Iterate safely**: Automated checks prevent issues

## Foundation Features

### Session Monitoring
Track your AI development in real-time:

```bash
# Basic monitoring
hyper dev watch

# Monitor specific files or directories
hyper dev watch --focus src/auth
hyper dev watch --focus "*.ts"
```

### Quality Validation
Ensure generated code meets standards:

```bash
# Run quality checks
hyper dev validate

# Check specific files
hyper dev validate src/components/Button.tsx
```

### Progress Tracking
Monitor development progress:

```bash
# Check current session status
hyper dev status

# View development reports
hyper dev report
```

## Advanced Features

### Intelligent Context Management
Advanced AI context optimization:

- **Dynamic Context Updates**: Automatically maintain relevant context for AI
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn from codebase patterns to improve generation
- **Objective Tracking**: Ensure AI stays focused on defined goals

### Quality Gates & Validation
Enterprise-grade quality assurance:

- **Real-time Security Scanning**: Immediate vulnerability detection during generation
- **Architecture Compliance**: Ensure generated code follows established patterns
- **Multi-layer Validation**: Security, quality, and compliance checks

### Performance Optimization
Monitor and optimize development performance:

- **Generation Speed Tracking**: Monitor AI response times
- **Resource Usage**: Track memory and processing usage
- **Quality Metrics**: Measure code quality improvements over time

## Subcommands
