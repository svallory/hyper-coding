# plan: Strategic Planning & Architecture

The **plan** tool provides comprehensive strategic planning capabilities for your development projects. It helps you create structured documentation, break down complex features, and maintain alignment between business objectives and technical implementation.

## Core Features

### Document Templates
- **technical-prd** - Comprehensive PRD with technical details
- **business-prd** - Business-focused PRD format  
- **feature-spec** - Lightweight feature specification
- **architecture-doc** - System architecture documentation
- **minimal-plan** - Basic planning structure
- **enterprise-prd** - Enterprise-grade PRD with compliance

### Planning Workflow
1. **Create Plan** - Initialize with template or from existing documents
2. **Document Requirements** - Structure business and technical requirements
3. **Design Architecture** - Create technical specifications and diagrams
4. **Break Down Tasks** - Decompose features into implementable tasks
5. **Track Progress** - Monitor implementation against plan

## Commands

### `hyper plan [plan-title]`
Start interactive planning session or work on specific plan.

```bash
# Start new planning session
hyper plan

# Work on specific plan
hyper plan "User Authentication System"

# Create plan with template
hyper plan --template technical-prd

# Initialize from existing document
hyper plan --from requirements.md
```

## File Structure

Plans are stored in `.hyper/plans/<plan-title>/` with organized documentation:

```
.hyper/plans/user-auth/
├── plan.yaml           # Plan metadata
├── prd.md             # Product requirements
├── architecture.md    # Technical architecture
├── tasks.yaml         # Task breakdown
└── progress.md        # Implementation progress
```

## Integration

The plan tool integrates with:
- Code generation (requirements-driven templates)
- Development monitoring (progress tracking)
- Quality assurance (requirement validation)
- Team collaboration (shared planning)

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Templates** - Use appropriate document templates
2. **Clear Requirements** - Define specific, measurable objectives
3. **Iterative Planning** - Refine plans based on feedback
4. **Track Progress** - Monitor implementation against requirements
5. **Team Collaboration** - Share plans for alignment and review

The **plan** tool transforms ad-hoc development into systematic, requirement-driven implementation with clear documentation and progress tracking.
