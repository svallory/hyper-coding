## Development Timeline Recommendations

### Revised Timeline (Based on Enhanced Analysis)
- **Task 6 (Analytics)**: 2 weeks (44 hours) - Medium Priority
- **Task 9 (Performance)**: 2 weeks (62 hours) - HIGH Priority
- **Task 10 (Help System)**: 2 weeks (58 hours) - Medium Priority

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- Tasks 6 and 9 can be developed in parallel after Task 3 completion
- Task 10 implementation can begin during Task 9 testing phase
- Subtasks within each task can be parallelized for faster completion

## Key Performance Targets

### Memory Usage
- **Baseline**: Current implementation ~50MB
- **Target**: <100MB with 1000+ tasks loaded
- **Alert Threshold**: 150MB for memory leak detection

### Response Times
