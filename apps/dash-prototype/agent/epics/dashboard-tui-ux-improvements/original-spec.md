# Original Epic Specification

## User Request

Check our current dashboard TUI, then read the docs at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vadimdemedes/ink/refs/heads/master/readme.md and look for ways to improve our UX. Also, remember that we are using Task Master under the hood and it can provide a lot of info that can be obtained using their CLI. Look at their "dashboard" for inspiration (it's just textual output).

## Context Provided

- Screenshot of current dashboard showing basic workflow monitoring with:
  - Epic name display with ASCII art borders
  - Progress bar and step tracking
  - Configuration panel (Research/No Stop/Max Agents)
  - Dependency status and next task information
  - Task list with completion status, priorities, and complexity
  - Simple navigation (only 'q' to quit)

## Analysis Performed

1. **Current Implementation Review**: Analyzed dashboard source code (`/work/rcs/epic-dashboard/dashboard/src/index.tsx`)
2. **Ink.js Capabilities Research**: Reviewed comprehensive documentation for advanced TUI features
3. **TaskMaster CLI Exploration**: Examined available commands and rich data output formats
4. **UX Gap Analysis**: Identified opportunities for enhanced interactivity and data presentation

## Key Findings

- Current dashboard is functional but static, underutilizing Ink.js capabilities
- TaskMaster CLI provides extensive analytics and task management data not exposed in dashboard
- Significant opportunity for enhanced user experience through interactive navigation and richer data presentation
- Need for progressive enhancement approach to maintain backward compatibility
