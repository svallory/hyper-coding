# Dashboard TUI UX Improvements Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: The current dashboard TUI provides basic workflow monitoring but lacks interactive capabilities, rich data insights, and efficient navigation that modern terminal users expect. It underutilizes both Ink.js capabilities and TaskMaster's comprehensive data.

**Solution**: Transform the dashboard into a progressive, interactive workflow management interface that maintains backward compatibility while adding keyboard navigation, TaskMaster integration, and enhanced data visualization.

**Value**: Improved developer productivity through consolidated workflow management, reduced context switching between tools, and actionable insights from comprehensive task analytics.
