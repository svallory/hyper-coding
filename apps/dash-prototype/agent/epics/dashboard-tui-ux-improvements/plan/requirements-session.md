# Requirements Session: Dashboard TUI UX Improvements

## User Problem Definition

**Q1**: What specific problems does the current dashboard have that frustrate users?
**A1**: *Based on analysis and screenshot*: Limited interactivity, static information display, no way to drill down into details, no historical context, single epic focus, and underutilization of available TaskMaster data.

**Q2**: Who experiences these problems and how often?
**A2**: *Inferred from context*: Developers and project managers using epic workflows daily, particularly those managing multiple epics or needing detailed task insights beyond basic progress monitoring.

**Q3**: What's the cost of not solving this?
**A3**: *Analyzed impact*: Reduced productivity from context switching between dashboard and TaskMaster CLI, missed insights from rich task data, inability to make informed workflow decisions from dashboard alone.

## Solution Scope

**Q4**: What's the minimal viable solution?
**A4**: *Determined from analysis*: Enhanced visual presentation with basic keyboard navigation, TaskMaster data integration for richer information display, and optional interactive mode while preserving current passive monitoring.

**Q5**: What would "done" look like for users?
**A5**: *Success criteria*: Users can navigate task details, view historical trends, switch between epics, access TaskMaster insights, and perform basic workflow management without leaving the dashboard.

**Q6**: What's explicitly out of scope?
**A6**: *Boundaries set*: Full task editing capabilities, replacing TaskMaster CLI entirely, web-based interfaces, or breaking changes to existing workflow-state.json format.

## Technical Requirements

**Q7**: What are the performance requirements?
**A7**: *Performance targets*: Dashboard startup under 1 second, data updates within 2 seconds, keyboard navigation response under 100ms, graceful handling of TaskMaster CLI latency.

**Q8**: What are the security/compliance needs?
**A8**: *Security considerations*: Read-only access to task data, no credential storage, safe CLI command execution, proper error handling for file access.

**Q9**: What external integrations are required?
**A9**: *Integration needs*: TaskMaster CLI commands (list, show, next, complexity-report), existing file watching system, potential for future web socket integration.

## Implementation Constraints

**Q10**: What's the timeline/deadline pressure?
**A10**: *Timeline considerations*: Incremental development preferred, must not disrupt current workflow usage, phased rollout with feature flags.

**Q11**: What resources are available?
**A11**: *Resource assessment*: Existing Ink.js expertise, TaskMaster CLI availability, React/TypeScript development stack.

**Q12**: What can't change in existing systems?
**A12**: *Constraints*: workflow-state.json format, basic file watching behavior, existing keyboard shortcuts ('q' to quit), cross-platform compatibility.

## Advanced Requirements Analysis

### Data Requirements
- **Real-time Updates**: Maintain current 1-2 second file watching responsiveness
- **Rich Task Data**: Access to task hierarchies, dependencies, complexity scores, priority breakdowns
- **Historical Context**: Ability to view workflow progression over time
- **Multi-Epic Support**: Navigate between different epic contexts seamlessly

### Interaction Requirements
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple view by default, rich features available on demand
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys, tab navigation, shortcuts for common actions
- **Mode Switching**: Toggle between passive monitoring and interactive management
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of missing TaskMaster, network issues, file corruption

### Visual Requirements
- **Enhanced Information Density**: Better use of screen real estate
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapt to different terminal sizes
- **Status Differentiation**: Clear visual hierarchy for different data types
- **Loading States**: Proper feedback during data fetching operations

### Integration Requirements
- **CLI Performance**: Background TaskMaster calls with caching
- **Fallback Strategy**: Function without TaskMaster CLI availability
- **Data Synchronization**: Coordinate between file watching and CLI data
- **Configuration Management**: User preferences for features and display options

## Success Metrics

**Measurable Outcomes**:
1. **User Efficiency**: Reduced time to access task information (target: 50% reduction)
2. **Feature Adoption**: Usage of interactive features vs passive monitoring
3. **Performance Maintenance**: No regression in startup or update times
4. **Error Rates**: Minimal CLI integration failures
5. **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on enhanced capabilities

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Backward Compatibility**: All current functionality preserved
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Enhanced features optional and discoverable
3. **Performance Standards**: Response times meet or exceed current implementation
4. **Error Handling**: Robust degradation when external dependencies unavailable
5. **Documentation**: Clear help system and keyboard shortcuts guide

## Implementation Notes

### For Task Generation
- Phase 1: Visual enhancements and basic navigation
- Phase 2: TaskMaster CLI integration and data enrichment
- Phase 3: Advanced interactive features and multi-epic support
- Each phase should generate 5-8 concrete implementation tasks
- Include testing and integration tasks for each feature
- Consider performance optimization and error handling tasks

### Technical Guidance
- Leverage existing React/Ink.js patterns from current implementation
- Follow established TypeScript conventions in the codebase
- Integrate with existing file watching and error handling systems
- Maintain cross-platform compatibility requirements
- Use existing build and deployment infrastructure

### Risk Mitigation
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Create comprehensive error handling for CLI integration
- Design fallback strategies for external dependency failures
- Plan performance monitoring and optimization strategies
