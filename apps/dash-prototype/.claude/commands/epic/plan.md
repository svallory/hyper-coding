## Phase 1: Project Assessment & Setup

### 1.1 Epic Initialization

**Parse Arguments:**

- If EPIC_NAME provided, use as working name
- Otherwise, generate working name from initial user input (e.g., "auth-system-validation")
- Create temporary workspace: `agent/tmp/[EPIC-WORKING-NAME]/`
- Initialize manifest: `agent/tmp/[EPIC-WORKING-NAME]/manifest.json`

**Initial Workspace Structure:**

```
agent/tmp/[EPIC-WORKING-NAME]/
├── manifest.json           # Artifact tracking and metadata
├── plan/                  # Planning documents
├── research/              # Research reports and findings
├── decisions/             # Important Technical Decisions (ITDs)
└── artifacts/             # Other generated content
```

**Manifest Structure (compatible with standard progress tracking):**

```json
{
  "epic": {
    "workingName": "[EPIC-WORKING-NAME]",
    "finalName": null,
    "status": "validation",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-16T14:30:00Z",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-01-16T14:30:00Z"
  },
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "id": "project-assessment",
      "path": "plan/project-assessment.md",
      "type": "analysis",
      "description": "Current project state and technical assessment",
      "phase": "assessment",
      "essential": true,
      "createdAt": "2025-01-16T14:30:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "phases": {
    "assessment": {
      "status": "in-progress",
      "startedAt": "2025-01-16T14:30:00Z"
    },
    "validation": { "status": "pending" },
    "requirements": { "status": "pending" },
    "generation": { "status": "pending" },
    "finalization": { "status": "pending" }
  },
  "decisions": [],
  "risks": [],
  "nextSteps": ["Complete project assessment", "Validate epic idea"]
}
```

### 1.2 Current Project Analysis

3. What technical debt would this epic address or create?
4. What resources can be leveraged vs. built new?

---

## Phase 2: Idea Validation & Challenge

### 2.1 Devil's Advocate Analysis

**Critical Assessment Framework:**

Save analysis to `agent/tmp/[EPIC-WORKING-NAME]/plan/validation-analysis.md` and update manifest:

```markdown
# Epic Validation: [EPIC-WORKING-NAME]

## Idea Summary

[User's proposed epic in 2-3 sentences]

## Critical Analysis

### ❌ Potential Problems

1. **Technical Risks**: [Implementation challenges, complexity]
2. **Business Risks**: [ROI concerns, user adoption]
3. **Resource Risks**: [Time, complexity, dependencies]
4. **Integration Risks**: [Conflicts with existing systems]

### 🔄 Superior Alternatives

1. **Simpler Approach**: [Minimal viable solution]
2. **Different Technology**: [Better suited tools/patterns]
3. **Phased Implementation**: [Incremental delivery strategy]
4. **Buy vs. Build**: [Existing solutions to consider]

### ⚠️ Show-Stoppers

[Critical issues that should halt the project]

### ✅ Validation Result

- **Recommendation**: [Proceed/Modify/Stop]
- **Reasoning**: [Key factors in decision]
- **Required Changes**: [Modifications needed]
```

**Challenge Strategy:**

1. **Question assumptions**: Is this the right problem to solve?
2. **Identify simpler alternatives**: What's the minimal solution?
3. **Assess technical fit**: Does this align with current architecture?
4. **Evaluate ROI**: Is the complexity justified?
5. **Check timing**: Is this the right priority now?

**Escalation Protocol:**

- **Minor concerns**: Suggest modifications and continue
- **Major concerns**: Present alternatives, require user confirmation
- **Critical issues**: Strongly recommend stopping, require explicit override

---

## Phase 3: Systematic Requirements Gathering

### 3.1 Gap Analysis & Questioning

**Structured Question Framework:**

Execute systematic questioning and save to `agent/tmp/[EPIC-WORKING-NAME]/plan/requirements-session.md`:

```markdown
# Requirements Session: [EPIC-WORKING-NAME]

## User Problem Definition

**Q1**: What specific problem does this solve?
**A1**: [User response]

**Q2**: Who experiences this problem and how often?
**A2**: [User response]

**Q3**: What's the cost of not solving this?
**A3**: [User response]

## Solution Scope

**Q4**: What's the minimal viable solution?
**A4**: [User response]

**Q5**: What would "done" look like for users?
**A5**: [User response]

**Q6**: What's explicitly out of scope?
**A6**: [User response]

## Technical Requirements

**Q7**: What are the performance requirements?
**A7**: [User response]

**Q8**: What are the security/compliance needs?
**A8**: [User response]

**Q9**: What external integrations are required?
**A9**: [User response]

## Implementation Constraints

**Q10**: What's the timeline/deadline pressure?
**A10**: [User response]

**Q11**: What resources are available?
**A11**: [User response]

**Q12**: What can't change in existing systems?
**A12**: [User response]
```

**Dynamic Questioning Strategy:**

- **Follow unclear answers**: Ask for specific examples
- **Challenge vague requirements**: Demand measurable criteria
- **Probe assumptions**: Question "standard" or "usual" responses
- **Identify conflicts**: Highlight contradictory requirements
- **Test edge cases**: Ask about failure scenarios

### 3.2 Missing Information Detection

**Information Gap Analysis:**

1. **Functional gaps**: Unclear user workflows
2. **Technical gaps**: Undefined performance/security requirements
3. **Integration gaps**: Undefined external dependencies
4. **Business gaps**: Unclear success metrics

**Targeted Follow-up Questions:**

- When responses are vague: "Give me a specific example"
- When requirements conflict: "How do we prioritize X vs Y?"
- When scope is unclear: "What happens if we only build 50% of this?"
- When risks are ignored: "What's the worst case scenario?"

## Phase 4: PRD Construction

### 4.1 Adaptive PRD Generation

**PRD Structure (optimized for Claude task generation):**

**CRITICAL**: Once requirements are gathered, immediately proceed to PRD generation without further user interaction.

Generate `agent/tmp/[EPIC-WORKING-NAME]/plan/prd.md`:

```markdown
# [EPIC-WORKING-NAME] Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: [Clear problem statement]
**Solution**: [Proposed solution approach]
**Value**: [Expected business/user value]

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements

**Core Features**:

## Implementation Notes

### For Task Generation

- Each phase should generate 5-8 concrete tasks
- Tasks should be implementation-focused, not planning
- Include testing and integration tasks for each feature
- Consider infrastructure and deployment tasks

### Technical Guidance

- Leverage existing [technology stack] patterns
- Follow established [architectural patterns]
- Integrate with [existing systems/services]
- Maintain [coding standards/conventions]
```

### 4.2 PRD Optimization for Task Generation

**Claude-Specific Optimizations:**

1. **Clear Implementation Phases**: Logical progression for task breakdown
2. **Concrete Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable outcomes for each feature
3. **Technical Context**: Sufficient detail for informed task generation
4. **Dependency Mapping**: Clear relationships between components
5. **Risk Awareness**: Known challenges to address in tasks

**Task Generation Hints:**

```markdown
## Task Generation Guidelines

### Recommended Task Categories

1. **Infrastructure Tasks**: [Database setup, API foundation, deployment]
2. **Core Feature Tasks**: [Primary functionality implementation]
3. **Integration Tasks**: [External systems, data flows]
4. **Testing Tasks**: [Unit, integration, E2E testing]
5. **Polish Tasks**: [Error handling, validation, optimization]

### Task Complexity Targets

- **Simple Tasks**: 1-2 days implementation
- **Medium Tasks**: 3-5 days implementation
- **Complex Tasks**: Should be broken into subtasks

### Critical Success Factors

- Each task should have clear acceptance criteria
- Tasks should build upon each other logically
- Include rollback/error scenarios
- Consider performance and security at each step
```

## Phase 5: Finalization & Handoff

### 5.1 Epic Name Confirmation

**Finalize Epic Name:**

- Review working name with user
- Confirm final epic name for production use
- Update manifest with final name
- Validate name doesn't conflict with existing epics

### 5.2 Artifact Organization & Research Integration

**Note**: When artifacts are moved to permanent location, ensure workflow state is also created following the standard format from `.claude/epic/progress-tracking.md` for seamless handoff to `plan-to-tasks` command.

**Additional Research & Decision Artifacts:**

During validation, create additional artifacts as needed:

```
agent/tmp/[EPIC-WORKING-NAME]/
├── research/
│   ├── technology-comparison.md    # Tech stack research
│   ├── competitor-analysis.md      # Market research
│   ├── performance-benchmarks.md  # Performance research
│   └── best-practices-study.md     # Industry standards
├── decisions/
│   ├── itd-001-architecture.md     # Important Technical Decision
│   ├── itd-002-database.md        # Database choice reasoning
│   └── itd-003-integration.md     # Integration approach
└── artifacts/
    ├── mockups/                    # UI mockups or sketches
    ├── diagrams/                   # Architecture diagrams
    └── prototypes/                 # Code prototypes
```

**Update Manifest for Each Artifact:**

```json
{
  "id": "tech-comparison",
  "path": "research/technology-comparison.md",
  "type": "research",
  "description": "Comparison of React vs Vue for frontend implementation",
  "phase": "validation",
  "essential": false,
  "tags": ["frontend", "technology-decision"],
  "createdAt": "2025-01-16T15:45:00Z",
  "relatedDecisions": ["itd-001-architecture"]
}
```

### 5.3 Move to Permanent Location

**Epic Creation Process:**

1. **Create permanent epic folder**: `agent/epics/[FINAL-EPIC-NAME]/`
2. **Copy essential artifacts** from temporary workspace
3. **Update all file references** to use final epic name
4. **Generate final manifest** for permanent location
5. **Clean up temporary workspace**: `rm -rf agent/tmp/[EPIC-WORKING-NAME]/`

**CRITICAL**: This move must happen immediately after PRD generation is complete - do not wait for user input.

**Progress Tracking Integration**: When moving to permanent location, create a workflow-state.json file using the standard schema from `.claude/epic/progress-tracking.md` to enable seamless handoff to the `plan-to-tasks` command:

```bash
# Create initial workflow state for plan-to-tasks handoff
echo '{
  "epic_name": "'$FINAL_EPIC_NAME'",
  "current_step": 0,
  "completed_steps": [],
  "workflow_config": {
    "no_stop": true,
    "max_subagents": 9,
    "use_research": null
  },
  "tag_name": null,
  "artifacts": {
    "original_doc": "original-spec.md",
    "prd": "prd.md"
  },
  "agents": {
    "required": [],
    "created": [],
    "available": []
  },
  "execution": {
    "tasks_in_progress": [],
    "tasks_completed": [],
    "parallel_agents_active": 0,
    "last_task_completion": null
  },
  "timestamp": "'$(date -Iseconds)'",
  "last_updated": "'$(date -Iseconds)'",
  "status": "ready-for-plan-to-tasks"
}' > agent/epics/$FINAL_EPIC_NAME/workflow-state.json
```

**Permanent Epic Structure:**

```
agent/epics/[FINAL-EPIC-NAME]/
├── manifest.json               # Final artifact manifest
├── original-spec.md           # Original user input/idea
├── prd.md                     # Final PRD for task generation
├── project-assessment.md      # Technical assessment
├── validation-analysis.md     # Validation and alternatives
├── requirements-session.md    # Requirements Q&A
├── research/                  # Research reports (if any)
│   └── *.md
├── decisions/                 # Important Technical Decisions
│   └── itd-*.md
└── artifacts/                 # Supporting materials
    ├── diagrams/
    ├── mockups/
    └── prototypes/
```

**Essential vs. Optional Artifacts:**

- **Essential** (always copy): PRD, assessments, validation, requirements
- **Optional** (copy if created): Research reports, ITDs, diagrams, prototypes
- **Temporary** (discard): Draft documents, working notes, intermediate files

### 5.4 Final Manifest Generation

**Permanent Manifest Structure:**

```json
{
  "epic": {
    "name": "[FINAL-EPIC-NAME]",
    "originalWorkingName": "[EPIC-WORKING-NAME]",
    "status": "ready-for-tasks",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-16T14:30:00Z",
    "finalizedAt": "2025-01-16T16:20:00Z",
    "planningSummary": {
      "problemStatement": "Brief problem description",
      "solutionApproach": "Brief solution summary",
      "keyDecisions": ["decision1", "decision2"],
      "risksMitigated": ["risk1", "risk2"]
    }
  },
  "artifacts": [

    "risksAccepted": ["manageable-risk1"]
  },
  "nextSteps": {
    "command": "/epic:plan-to-tasks",
    "arguments": "[FINAL-EPIC-NAME] agent/epics/[FINAL-EPIC-NAME]/prd.md",
    "expectedOutcome": "18-25 tasks generated with proper dependencies"
  }
}
```

### 5.5 Handoff Instructions

**Ready for Task Generation:**

**CRITICAL**: Always end the planning session with these exact instructions:

````markdown
## ✅ Epic Planning Complete: [FINAL-EPIC-NAME]

### ⚠️ Context Management

**Check your context usage before proceeding**. Epic planning can consume significant context.

- If you have less than 30% context remaining, run `/clear` before the next command
- If unsure about context level, run `/clear` to be safe

### Next Command

```bash
/epic:plan-to-tasks [FINAL-EPIC-NAME] agent/epics/[FINAL-EPIC-NAME]/prd.md
```
````

### Planning Artifacts Created

- **📋 PRD**: Comprehensive requirements for task generation
- **🔍 Assessment**: Current project state and constraints
- **⚔️ Validation**: Critical analysis and alternatives considered
- **❓ Requirements**: Complete Q&A session with gap analysis
- **📚 Research**: [X research reports] on key technical decisions (if any)
- **⚡ ITDs**: [X decisions] documented with rationale

### Quality Gates Passed

✅ Problem clearly defined with measurable outcomes
✅ Technical approach validated against current architecture\
✅ Critical concerns addressed or explicitly accepted
✅ Requirements gaps identified and filled
✅ Implementation phases logically structured
✅ Risk mitigation strategies defined

### Epic Location

📁 `agent/epics/[FINAL-EPIC-NAME]/`

🎯 **The epic is ready for task generation with comprehensive planning context.**

**INTERNAL NOTE FOR AGENT**: Epic planning is now COMPLETE. Do not continue with task generation - that's handled by the separate `/epic:plan-to-tasks` command above. This message is for the agent's guidance only and should not be shown to the user.

```
**Planning Session Ends Here**: The agent must stop after providing these instructions and not proceed to task generation.
