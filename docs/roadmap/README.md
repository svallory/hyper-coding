# HyperDev Roadmap Documentation

This folder contains forward-looking concepts and features that extend beyond the current MVP implementation plan.

## Current Documents

### [AI Intrusive Thoughts](./ai-intrusive-thoughts.md)
Implementing peripheral awareness for AI code generation - helping AI agents recall relevant context without explicit prompting, similar to how human developers have "intrusive thoughts" about existing code.

**Status**: Phase 3 research concept  
**Key Insight**: AI agents lack the spontaneous recall that prevents human developers from duplicating existing functionality.

## Document Guidelines

Roadmap documents should capture:
- **Core insight or problem** being addressed
- **High-level solution concept** without implementation details
- **Use cases and value proposition**
- **Roadmap positioning** (which phase, prerequisites)
- **Success metrics** and decision criteria
- **Open questions** and research needs

Keep documents focused on **strategic direction** rather than tactical implementation - save detailed design for task planning phases.

## Contributing Ideas

When adding new roadmap documents:
1. Focus on **problems worth solving** rather than cool technology
2. Consider **user value** and **implementation complexity**
3. Identify **prerequisites** and **interdependencies**  
4. Define **success criteria** and **failure conditions**
5. Keep **scope manageable** - favor focused features over grand visions
