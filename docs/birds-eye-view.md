# HyperDev Birds-Eye View

## Project Overview

**HyperDev** implements the **Hyper Coding methodology** - a systematic approach to AI-assisted development that engineers quality controls, context management, and validation gates to transform AI from unpredictable code generation into a controlled, high-quality development accelerator.

## Core Problem Being Solved

**"Vibe Coding" Problems**:
- 40-45% of AI-generated code contains security vulnerabilities
- AI loses context and creates duplicate/inconsistent code
- No quality gates between generation and integration
- Technical debt accumulates rapidly
- Architecture patterns drift over time

**Hyper Coding Solution**:
- Multi-layer validation gates with immediate feedback
- Context engineering and scope boundary enforcement  
- Background monitoring for instant hook responses
- Epic-driven development with clear objectives
- Security-first approach with automated scanning

## What We've Established

### Research Foundation
- **Researcher A**: Quality checklists, tooling categories, perfect project setup patterns
- **Researcher B**: Enterprise concerns mapping, Hyper Coding methodology, comprehensive solution tables
- **Key Insight**: Need specific tool choices for MVP rather than endless options

### Technical Implementation Plan
**Location**: `agent/notes/hyperdev/technical-implementation-plan.md`

**MVP Tool Stack**:
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint + Prettier, TypeScript strict mode
- **Security**: TruffleHog, Snyk, Semgrep, npm audit  
- **Testing**: Vitest, Playwright, @testing-library, MSW
- **Architecture**: ts-arch, dependency-cruiser, madge
- **Build**: Bun, Vite, Moon (monorepos)

**4-Phase Implementation**:
1. **Months 1-2**: Complete Hypergen (template composition, trust system)
2. **Month 3**: Hyper Coding Template (Go CLI + npm-distributed hypergen)
3. **Months 4-5**: `hyper dev` daemon + advanced hooks
4. **Months 6+**: Peripheral awareness & AI intrusive thoughts

### Claude Code Integration Strategy

**Hook Configuration**:
- **PostToolUse**: Immediate validation after code changes
- **PreToolUse**: Architecture/scope validation before generation
- **SessionStart**: Project context loading

**Custom Commands**:
- `/project:mission` - Define objectives and scope boundaries
- `/epic:plan` - Task breakdown with dependency analysis
- `/quality:check` - Comprehensive validation

**Enhanced CLAUDE.md**: Project patterns, quality standards, security requirements

### Key Innovations

#### Go CLI + npm-distributed Hypergen Architecture
**Problem**: Need fast, beautiful CLI without sacrificing JS/TS generation engine
**Solution**: Go CLI (`hyper`) auto-installs `@hyperdev/hypergen` from npm, uses as subprocess
**Impact**: Best of both worlds - Go performance/UX + proven TS generation logic

#### Background Monitoring Daemon (`hyper dev`)
**Problem**: Hook validation takes 10-30 seconds, killing development flow  
**Solution**: Pre-computed validation cache, hooks query results in <100ms
**Impact**: Transforms "wait for validation" to "instant feedback"

#### Epic-Driven Development  
**Process**: Mission definition → Epic planning → Quality validation → Controlled implementation → Integration testing → Deployment readiness

## Success Metrics

### Immediate (Day 1)
- Zero hardcoded secrets in codebase
- 100% commit message compliance  
- Consistent code formatting
- TypeScript strict mode enforcement

### Short-term (Weeks 1-2)  
- 80% test coverage for new code
- Zero high/critical security vulnerabilities
- All PRs pass automated checks
- Architecture boundaries respected

### Medium-term (Month 1)
- 50% reduction in PR review time
- 90% reduction in project setup time  
- 40% faster feature delivery
- Zero production security incidents

### Long-term (Month 3)
- 70% reduction in production bugs
- 60% reduction in onboarding time
- 80% reduction in technical debt accumulation  
- Sustained development velocity improvement

## Roadmap Concepts

### Phase 3: AI Intrusive Thoughts
**Location**: `docs/roadmap/ai-intrusive-thoughts.md`

**Concept**: Give AI agents "peripheral awareness" similar to human intrusive thoughts  
**Problem**: AI duplicates existing functionality because similar code isn't in context
**Solution**: Background similarity detection + hook-injected "thoughts" about existing code
**Impact**: Prevent duplicate utilities, maintain naming consistency, optimize dependencies

## Current Status

- ✅ Research analysis complete
- ✅ MVP tool stack selected  
- ✅ Implementation roadmap defined
- ✅ Claude Code integration strategy planned
- ✅ Background daemon concept established
- ✅ Roadmap documentation structure created
- ✅ Architecture decisions finalized (Go CLI + npm hypergen)
- ✅ Backlog documentation created

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Hypergen**: Finish template composition, trust system, and CLI improvements
2. **Build Go CLI**: Create `hyper` CLI with Charmbracelet libraries + npm integration
3. **Create Hyper Coding Template**: One-command setup for complete methodology
4. **Implement Background Daemon**: `hyper dev` for instant validation feedback

## Key Files & Locations

- **Main Plan**: `agent/notes/hyperdev/technical-implementation-plan.md`
- **Research**: `agent/notes/hyperdev/researcher A/` and `researcher B/`  
- **Roadmap**: `docs/roadmap/`
- **Backlog**: `docs/backlog.md`
- **Project Context**: `CLAUDE.md`, `MISSION.md`

## Philosophy

**Balance**: Harness AI acceleration while maintaining code quality, security, and architectural integrity  
**Approach**: Engineer the system that generates the product rather than coding the product directly
**Focus**: Prove one specific stack works completely before expanding to multiple options
